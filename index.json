The system automatically switches over to the electromechanical parking brake when the car is stopped for a longer period of time while hold assist is activated. This ensures that the car will remain stationary even without activation of the parking brake. In conjunction with S tronic, after a stop at a traffic light, for instance, the car drives off as soon as the driver presses the accelerator pedal. The system is activated by pushing a button.\nAudi pre sense basic Audi pre sense basic initiates preventive safety measures for occupants as soon as it recognizes a critical driving state. It utilizes information from various vehicle systems to determine this. For instance, it intervenes if the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC) sensors detect skidding or hard braking. Then the system pretensions the seat belts of the driver and front passenger electrically to reduce their forward or lateral movements. The side windows and sliding sunroof are automatically closed. In addition, the hazard warning lights are activated to alert following traffic.\nCruise control Cruise control maintains a desired driving speed constantly starting at around 30 km/h (18.6 mph) (model dependent), provided that it can be maintained by engine power and engine braking effects. The system offers relief to drivers in this way – especially on long trips. At the same time, the constant speed mode of driving contributes towards lower fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions. The system is operated via a separate steering column stalk, and the preset driving speed is shown in the instrument cluster. The system is deactivated when the driver brakes.\nParking system plus Parking system plus informs the driver, visually and audibly, about obstacles in front of and behind the vehicle. The warnings are made when the distance to a detected object in the path of driving is less than 90 cm (35.4 in) – depending on the specific model – after the driver has engaged reverse gear and activated the system by pushing a button on the center console. Ultrasonic sensors inconspicuously integrated into the bumpers measure the distance. The MMI display depicts it visually. A white segment shows a detected object outside of the driving path. Red segments represent detected objects within the driving path. The virtual driving path display also shows lateral guide lines which are precalculated based on the currently selected steering input and thereby assists in convenient parking and exiting. Increasing frequency of the audible warning indicates that the distance to the obstacle is decreasing. At around 30 cm (11.8 in) distance to the detected object, the driver hears a constant tone – the signal to stop.\nAudi active lane assist Operating at speeds from 65 km/h (40.4 mph), Audi active lane assist helps the driver keep the vehicle in the driving lane. A camera detects lane lines and the track that the car is following between them. In this process, the camera can distinguish between yellow lines in construction zones and standard white markings. If the car approaches a line without the turn signal being activated, the system helps the driver to steer back into the lane by means of gentle but noticeable interventions in the electromechanical power steering. In the MMI system, the driver sets how early the control intervention should occur. In the case of an early steering intervention point, the system guides the driver towards the middle of the lane by gentle, centering steering interventions. With a late steering intervention point, Audi active lane assist does not intervene until shortly before the detected lane marking might be crossed; then it gives a corrective steering intervention in the proper direction. In addition, the driver may choose to be warned by a vibration of the steering wheel when crossing detected lane markings.\nSpeed limiter The configurable speed limiter limits driving speed to a value set by the driver within the speed range of 30 to 250 km/h (18.6 to 155.3 mph) – which is very helpful within city limits or construction zones, for example. When the preset limit is reached, the vehicle gently throttles the speed down. The speed limit is not exceeded even if the driver applies more pressure to the accelerator pedal. However, the driver can temporarily override the limit by kick-down, and the speed limiter can be completely deactivated at any time from the steering column stalk. The speed that has been preset is shown in the instrument cluster.\nTour driver assistance package The following driver assistance systems are part of the tour driver assistance package with option id PCC\nAdaptive cruise control (with Stop\u0026amp;Go function) Adaptive cruise control (ACC) offers relief to drivers especially on long trips and in stop-and-go traffic. It maintains a preset distance to the vehicle ahead by automatically accelerating and braking. The driver can choose from five distance levels and adjust acceleration and control system dynamics with Audi drive select.\nThe system uses radar sensors and a front camera. They detect vehicles ahead and measure the distance to them. In interplay with S tronic or tiptronic, the system covers the entire speed range from 0 to 250 km/h (155.3 mph). With a manual transmission, it starts at 30 km/h (18.6 mph). When the system is deactivated, the distance indicator shows the distance to the car ahead and warns drivers when they are tailgating. Its operating speed range is 60 km/h (37.3 mph) and above.\nWhen combined with S tronic or tiptronic, ACC also includes the Stop\u0026amp;Go function. In heavy traffic, it autonomously decelerates the car to a stop. After a brief stop, it automatically resumes driving, following the vehicle ahead. After a longer stop, the driver must tap the accelerator pedal or the control stalk on the steering column. In addition to the radar sensors and front camera, ultrasonic sensors also monitor the vehicle’s immediate surroundings.\n(Predictive) efficiency assist Efficiency assist helps the driver to drive preemptively and save fuel. The system works closely together with adaptive cruise control (ACC) or adaptive cruise assist (ACA). It accesses predictive route data from navigation and Car-to-X information. In order to detect traffic signs and other vehicles, the efficiency assist uses the front camera as well as data from the front and rear-facing radar sensors.\nThe driver is shown corresponding information in the instrument cluster or in the Audi virtual cockpit and the head-up display as soon as it would be sensible to take the foot off the right-hand pedal. Symbols for speed limits, bends, roundabouts, towns, or downhill slopes that indicate to the driver to slow down are displayed on the basis of the route data and recognition of traffic signs. Depending on the model the gas pedal also pulses against the sole of the driver’s foot – a clear indication to take their foot off the gas.\nIf the cruise assist is switched on or the ACC is activated, efficiency assist regulates actively. It decelerates and accelerates predictively and adapts the speed to the course of the road and the traffic situation, also taking vehicles driving in front into account. If the driver so wishes, the system controls the freewheeling and coasting operation of the engine in cooperation with other control units. The predictive system always maintains a driving style that reflects the driving program selected – from efficient to sporty – and uses scope for recuperation in the Audi e-tron.\nThe driver can override the system at any time by accelerating and braking. In addition, drivers can individually activate, deactivate and configure many of their detailed functions in the MMI. Depending on the model, the control, for example, can be adapted to the course of the road in three stages: slow, medium or fast.\nTurn assist Turn assist monitors the road lane with oncoming traffic by means of radar sensors, the front camera and, in certain models, a laser scanner. Monitoring is initiated as soon as the driver sets the turn signal. When driving off from a stop, or during slow driving up to a speed of 10 km/h (6.2 mph), the system can intervene by applying the brakes to prevent the car from colliding with an oncoming vehicle when turning left or right (country-dependent). This brake intervention keeps the vehicle within its own driving lane. The driver is informed of the intervention by an indicator in the instrument cluster.\nCollision avoidance assist Collision avoidance assist helps the driver steer around an obstacle in a critical situation. The system uses data from the two radar sensors and the front camera for this purpose. In calculating a suitable evasive maneuver corridor, it takes into account the distance, width and offset of the vehicle driving ahead. Collision avoidance assist is available over a speed range from approx. 30 to 150 km/h (18.6 to 93.2 mph), and it assumes that the driver is actively steering throughout the maneuver. The driver is informed of the intervention by an indicator in the instrument cluster.\nFirst, a jolt is produced to warn the driver of the hazard. If the driver then actively avoids the obstacle, the assistant applies a slight steering torque that helps by correcting the driver’s steering input or helping to make a lane change. Models like the Audi A8 (2017) use a specific braking of individual wheels – with it the vehicle is made to follow the computed course.\nThis is part of the tour package with option id PCC on Audi e-tron\nTraffic sign recognition Camera-based traffic sign recognition detects traffic signs such as speed limit signs (including digital signs), no passing zones, entry restriction signs and other auxiliary signs, and it shows them to the driver in graphic form. They then appear in the driver information system and/or the Audi virtual cockpit as well as in the head-up display. The camera on the windshield also detects temporary speed restrictions such as in construction zones, as well as time- and weather-conditional restrictions. The system shows the currently applicable speed limit. For example, if a lower speed applies when the road is wet, this value is displayed – if the windshield wipers are on. Speed limits that are only in force at certain times of day are only shown at those times. In addition, the driver can choose a warning threshold as an offset to the legal speed limit. When this threshold is exceeded, a visual warning is given.\nEmergency assist Emergency assist detects, within system limits, when the driver is inactive. In such a case, the system assumes control of the vehicle and automatically brakes it to a standstill in its own lane. Emergency assist monitors the driver’s steering activity. If it detects that the driver is inactive, it prompts the driver repeatedly, via visual and audible warnings and by brake jolts, to actively take over control of the vehicle again. With the first strong brake jolt at a driving speed below 80 km/h (49.7 mph), the hazard warning lights are also activated to warn the surrounding traffic. If the driver remains inactive, despite the warnings, Emergency assist brings the vehicle to a standstill within system limits. The parking brake is engaged. The driver can deactivate Emergency assist at any time by moving the steering wheel, pressing the brake or accelerator pedal or by shutting off active lane assist or adaptive cruise control.\nCity assistance package The following driver assistance system are part of the city assistance package with option id PCM\nAudi pre sense front / Audi pre sense city Audi pre sense front and Audi pre sense city utilize the data of radar sensors and/or the front camera, depending on the car model, to compute the probability of a collision. Within the limitations of the system, it warns of collision threats and initiates braking at specific vehicle speeds. Vehicles are detected in the driving speed range of up to 250 km/h (155.3 mph), pedestrians up to around 65 km/h (40.4 mph) or 85 km/h (52.8 mph) depending on the model, as well as cyclists, depending on the system.\nIf a collision is imminent, the system warns the driver with visual, acoustic and haptic warnings based on a multistage warning concept. If necessary, the system provides braking assistance to reduce vehicle speed or initiates a full brake application to avoid the collision under certain circumstances. Actions are also taken to protect occupants. The hazard warning lights are activated, the seat belts are reversibly pretensioned, the seat position is optimized, and the windows and optional panoramic glass sunroof are closed.\nAudi side assist The Audi side assist lane-changing assistant helps the driver to change lanes at driving speeds of 15 km/h (9.3 mph) and faster. It uses two rear-mounted radar sensors with a scanning range of roughly 70 meters (229.7 ft). If the system detects a vehicle located in the blind spot or approaching quickly from the rear, a warning LED is lit in the housing of the relevant exterior mirror. If the driver activates the turn signal anyway, the LED flashes several times in rapid succession.\nExit warning Exit warning improves safety in city traffic. If the car has come to a stop and other vehicles or bicyclists classified as critical are approaching from the rear, the system warns passengers not to open the doors. The system does this using LED lights in the door panels. In a situation assessed to be hazardous, the LEDs flicker and light red. The LEDs of Audi side assist are also lit in the relevant exterior side mirror. The exit warning remains active for approximately three minutes after the ignition is turned off.\nThis system is based on the radar sensors of Audi side assist, which monitor the zones behind the vehicle and to the sides at the rear. Depending on the model the exit warning is extended by an additional feature: If the system is active, opening of the electronic door locks is delayed roughly one second.\nCross traffic assist rear Cross traffic assist rear warns the driver of approaching vehicles it deems critical when slowly backing up, such as when pulling out of a perpendicular parking spot. It uses the rear radar sensors for this. They cover the zone at the rear, including the driving lanes to the left and right behind the vehicle. The warnings are progressive – initially a visual warning is shown in the MMI display (in the park assist display). The situation is represented in a virtual top view and in the “rear” and “rear side” camera views. Red arrows behind the vehicle point in the direction from which there is a potential hazard. If the driver does not react to the visual display, an audible signal sounds before the system warns the driver with a brake jolt. This helps to avoid accidents while exiting parking spaces.\nAudi pre sense rear Audi pre sense rear uses radar sensors in the rear bumper to detect an impending rear-end collision, and it initiates preventive safety measures. These include pretensioning the front seat belts by electric power and closing the windows and sliding sunroof. In addition, the system activates the hazard warning lights to alert following traffic to the critical situation. In this process, the Rear-end collision alert signal (RECAS) is triggered, which flashes the hazard warning lights at a high frequency. Audi pre sense rear is active in background over the car’s entire driving speed range with the exception of trailer towing situations.\nAudi pre sense side Audi pre sense side reacts in the event of a collision from the side. Amongst ohthers it uses the radar sensors of the crossing assist to calculate the probability of an accident involving traffic approaching from the side. The system can detect the threat of side collisions at speeds of up to approx. 60 km/h (37.3 mph) and apply preventative measures to help protect occupants. These include: activating the hazard lights, tensioning the safety belts, optimizing the seating position, and closing windows as well as the optional panoramic glass roof.\nIn an impending lateral collision at more than 25 km/h (15.5 mph), the suspension actuators of the optional Audi AI active suspension raise the body on the side exposed to the danger by up to 80 millimeters (3.1 in) within half a second. The other vehicle therefore hits the car in an even more impact-resistant zone. The side sills and floor structure accommodate a large portion of the impact forces. Deformation of the cabin and the loads acting on the occupants, above all to the chest and abdomen areas, are reduced by up to 50 percent compared with a lateral collision with no raising of the suspension.\nOther optional driver assystence systems Park assist Park assist can automatically steer the car into parallel or perpendicular parking spaces. It uses ultrasonic sensors located in the front and rear bumpers and on the sides. The driver only has to accelerate, brake and shift gears.\nThe sensors measure parking spaces along the road while driving past them at moderate speed – a maximum of 20 km/h (12.4 mph) for perpendicular parking spaces and a maximum of 30 km/h (18.6 mph) for parallel spaces. A message appears on the MMI display when the system finds a suitable spot. The only actions required of the driver while parking are accelerating, shifting gears and braking. The system handles the steering. In addition, audible signals help the driver. Park assist will make multiple maneuvers, forwards and backwards, if necessary. It can also exit from parallel parking spaces. Depending on the model, the driver activates the system via either a button on the center console or a button in the lower infotainment display. The maximum speed for all maneuvers is 7 km/h (4.3 mph).\nPark assist has option id 7X5 and is available as function on demand throug the myAudiApp\n360 degree cameras The four 360 degree cameras on the vehicle scan the immediate vicinity and display obstacles within. Drivers can choose from different views that simplify parking and maneuvering. A virtual overhead view shown in the MMI display gives the driver an overview of the overall parking situation. The panoramic view to the front and rear covers an angle of nearly 180 degrees and provides better visibility when exiting tight parking spaces, courtyard entrances and confusing intersections. Guide lines in the reversing camera view make it easier to park in perpendicular spaces and to hitch trailers. The view from the front camera helps when maneuvering, as it detects obstacles in front of the car. The system is automatically activated when driving in reverse or by pushing a button.\nAn additional feature for some models is a virtual 3D view. The driver can use the touchscreen to steplessly swivel and zoom the image of the car and the actual vehicle surroundings. There is also a view of the front or rear tires so that the driver can pull the car up right next to the curb.\nCurb warning The curb warning identifies curbs that pose a risk to the tires or wheels. Prerequisite: The car is moving forward or backward at up to 10 km/h (6.2 mph). If the system detects a critical situation, it alerts the driver to this in the optical parking system display on the MMI monitor. To scan the surroundings the system uses primarily the 360 degree cameras.\nHigh-beam assist High-beam assist utilizes a camera mounted on the interior mirror. It detects light sources – the headlights of oncoming vehicles, tail lights of other road users and the reflections of municipality limit signs, for instance – and automatically switches between high beam and low beam lighting. This provides for better visibility and a more relaxed driving experience. Drivers of oncoming vehicles are not blinded by glare.\nThis is part of the HD-matrix lighning.\nManeuvering assist Maneuvering assist recognizes moving and stationary objects larger than 10 centimeters (3.9 in), such as a pillar in a parking garage or a moving vehicle. It helps to avoid impending collisions using warning steering impulses and by autonomously braking the car to a stop, provided that the car is traveling forward or in reverse at no more than 10 km/h (6.2 mph). The system uses the optical parking system in the MMI to display its steering and parking interventions. The surroundings are scanned using at least the ultrasonic sensors and the 360 degree cameras.\nNight vision assist The night vision assist that Audi offers for multiple full-size models uses a far infrared camera. It reacts to the heat given off by objects. Converted to black and white images, the information can be viewed in the instrument cluster or Audi virtual cockpit. The cooler surroundings appear dark, while animals and people appear strikingly bright.\nThe system, which has a range of up to 300 meters (984.3 ft), can detect people and larger wild animals at distances between roughly 10 and 90 meters (32.8 and 295.3 ft) and highlights them with yellow markings. If a hazardous situation is detected, a warning sound is emitted. A warning symbol appears in the instrument cluster as well as in the head-up display. Depending on the headlights persons outside of town limits are illuminated with three short flashes of light.\nReversing camera The reversing camera simplifies maneuvering by showing the zone behind the vehicle on the MMI display. It shows the calculated driving track based on the steering angle as well as auxiliary lines and guide lines. For parallel parking, the latter lines precisely direct steering into the parking space in conjunction with steering reversal points. The blue pictured surface in the camera image indicates where the vehicle will be positioned after the parking procedure. The reversing camera is inconspicuously integrated into the handle trim strip of the luggage compartment lid. It is activated as soon as the driver engages reverse gear or pushes the respective button.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.github.io/models/e-tron/","title":"Audi e-tron","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron 55 had world premiere at September 17. 2018 and was the first all-electric series production model","content":"Later the Audi e-tron 50 and Audi e-tron 50/55 Sportback was released.

The SUV is the first vehicle to combine electric mobility with Audi quality: A sophisticated drive and recuperation system, all-wheel drive and maximum comfort. In short: Vorsprung durch Technik. The e-tron is based on an extensively adapted variant of the modular longitudinal platform (MLB evo). Its foundation is a new body shape with numerous innovative structural elements in the lower area of the vehicle center and the roof.\nWith a wheelbase length of 2,928 millimeters (115.3 in), the e-tron lies between the Q5 and Q7 SUVs. The high-voltage battery stores up to 95 kWh of energy and forms the basis for its range of more than 400 kilometers (248.6 mi) in the WLTP driving cycle. This is achieve primarily by the innovative recuperation system, which can recover up to 30 percent of the used energy during brake applications. The two asynchronous motors (ASM) of the full-size class SUV achieve a maximum joint output of 300 kW and ensure a sporty and stable performance on any terrain in cooperation with the electric all-wheel drive, which can be adjusted extremely quickly.\nThe Audi e-tron can charge using both alternating and direct current and is the first series-production vehicle with a charging capacity of up to 150 kW.

In accordance with the WLTP standard, the Audi e-tron GT concept achieves a range of more than 400 kilometers (248.5 mi) on one battery charge. The battery, which has an energy content of more than 90 kWh, is located in the underbody, between the axles. The battery package is designed with recesses in the rear footwell. This provides a high level of seating comfort for all occupants. This special layout allows the drive battery to be integrated in the vehicle floor despite the low body position that is typical for sports cars, thereby creating a very low vehicle center of gravity. At the same time, this creates comfortable seating ergonomics. Its lightweight design body and the roof made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) are built according to the principle of multi-material construction. At 4.96 meters (16.3 ft) long, 1.96 meters (6.4 ft) wide and 1.38 meters (4.5 ft) tall, the near-production-level Audi e-tron GT concept has the proportions of a typical Gran Turismo. In combination with the low center of gravity, the quattro drive, which is equipped with an electric motor at the front and rear axles, offers ideal conditions for a sports car. The drive management distributes the torques of the electric motors between the axles as needed and also regulates the wheels separately. The technology layout allows for numerous suspension and performance features, for example all-wheel steering or a sport differential, providing excellent traction and a high level of vehicle dynamics. Electric motors with different outputs and battery modules with different capacities will be used in series production.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.github.io/technology/bev-platforms/meb/","title":"Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB)","tags":[],"description":"What the modular transversal toolkit (MQB) is for the model range with combustion engines, the modular electrification toolkit (MEB) will be for the all-electric Audi models.","content":"The MEB provides the technical basis for the future compact and medium-size class models from Audi. This platform thus provides the entry point into the electric model portfolio of the brand with the four rings\nBy using the group-wide MEB platform, Audi can offer its customers affordable yet technically sophisticated electric models with the unmistakable Audi DNA. Fascinating design, high\u0002quality interior workmanship and a top-of-the-line operating system. The use of maximum platform synergies in the Group makes electric mobility attractive to many new customers in the compact segment. The modular electric drive platform of the Volkswagen Group is designed to be highly versatile and scalable to a high degree. Its matrix extends from SUVs and crossover models all the way to sedans.\nAs it is designed exclusively for electric drives, the MEB allows customers to experience all the advantages that compact electric motors and lithium-ion batteries in different sizes and capacities offer. The battery systems, electric motors and axle designs form a stringent technology toolkit.\nIn contrast to the current models with combustion engines, the front section is considerably shorter—the front axle and firewall move forward, making the wheelbase and thus the usable interior space considerably larger.\nIn March 2019, Audi announced the Q4 e-tron concept with a near-production-level showcar at the Geneva Motor Show. It will be the first Audi based on the MEB platform to roll off the line: A compact SUV that fits into the same segment as the conventionally motorized Q3. Its exterior length of 4.59 meters (15.1 ft) places it in the upper third of the compact class; thanks to its wheelbase of 2.76 meters (9.1 ft), however, its interior is at least at the level of the medium-size class.\nIn terms of interior length, each MEB model thus corresponds to a current vehicle from the next higher category. While the exterior dimensions of the Q4 e-tron concept are comparable to those of the Q3, it offers the interior dimensions of a Q5. The architecture of the dashboard also offers new design opportunities. Of course the MEB platform also offers different performance levels and drive layouts. In addition to the typical quattro all-wheel drive with an electric motor at the front and rear axles, there will also be a drive variant with a rear-mounted engine and rear-wheel drive for the entry\u0002level variants.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.github.io/guides/onepedaldriving/","title":"How to use one pedal driving on e-tron","tags":[],"description":"Many less advanced EVs support one pedal driving meaning that when you lift the foot from the  accelorator (gas pedal) it will actively reduce the speed using regeneration.","content":"In this way, you never need to use the brake pedal (you can if it is an emergency). That is the reason they call it \u0026ldquo;one-pedal-driving\u0026rdquo;\nAudi has not made it possible to enable one pedal driving permanent. They rather want their drivers to maximize the effiency with coasting instead of automatic reducing speed when you lift the foot of the gas pedal. One pedal driving is less efficient since you loose energy compared to coasting. This is because you only get approx 80% of the kinetic energy the moving car has, back to the battery, when doing recuperation. (Assuming the traffic and road allow to coast) You is also forced to have the foot on the pedal at a specific position to freeroll/coast to find the position when no energy is going out of the battery and nothing is going in.\nOn Audi e-tron can set recuperation to manual (MMI -\u0026gt; Vehicle -\u0026gt; Effiency Assistant -\u0026gt; Recupration) and then you can every time you start a drive, set recuperation to the max with the steering wheel recuperation paddels, and then it will regenerate every time you lift your foot of the \u0026ldquo;gas pedal\u0026rdquo; and works as \u0026ldquo;one-pedal-driving\u0026rdquo;.\nWith the whel paddles you can set the recuperation to 3 different levels. (for more or less braking). High, medium and off. This is the left paddle to increase regen. Right paddle to reduce regen.. This shows how the regen is on 50% on max. This is not recommended for experienced drivers. If you learn to coast you will get the best comfort and the best range. Next time it will be reset back. For drivers coming from other EV\u0026rsquo;s, this might be the way to unlearn the bad habit.\nIf you set it recuperation to automatic it will only recuperate when you are getting close to others cars or you are close to a intersection or other reasons you need to slow down. Otherwise it will coast and save the maximum amount of energy as long you don\u0026rsquo;t press the accelerator.\nMore information In depth article on InsideEevs\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.github.io/technology/bev-platforms/ppe/","title":"PPE (Premium Platform Electric)","tags":[],"description":"For its full-size class and luxury models, Audi is relying on a fourth platform.","content":"The Premium Platform Electric (PPE) has been designed and developed in cooperation with Porsche from the start. Porsche will use it for their upcoming Porsche Macan, while Audi will use it for Audi Q6 e-tron and A6 e-tron.\nWith its special architecture, it provides the conditions needed for ultra-modern technology that satisfies the demanding customer requests in the full-size and luxury class segments.\nPPE will take on the role in the world of electric vehicles that the modular longitudinal platform holds in vehicles powered by combustion engines. It is characterized by a high-tech and highly scalable architecture that allows both low- and high-floor vehicles to be realized.\nAudi is developing various model series on the basis of PPE that will cover the segments from the upper medium-size class to the luxury class as SUVs, Sportbacks, Avants and Crossovers with various different vehicle types. In doing so, the brand is also expanding its current model portfolio in the full-size class and luxury segments by adding numerous electric variants.\nThe technology package on the PPE is generally similar to that of the MEB; in addition, it offers great potential in terms of output and performance. As standard, the vehicles are fitted with one electric motor in the rear; the top-of-the-range models are equipped with a second electric motor at the front axle (PSM or ASM) that allows them to activate all-wheel drive automatically when needed. If will of course also be possible to realize different performance levels and battery capacities on the PPE platform. Like in the Audi e-tron GT concept, the state of charge is 800 volts; in combination with high-efficiency thermal management, it enables a high charging capacity of 350 kW.\nBattery sizes are unknown at current time, but A6 e-tron concept have 100kWh net and a range of 700 km WLTP. This will indicate a consumption on 14.2 kWh/100km that indicate a very efficient drivetrain.\nThe dimensions and overhangs of the low-floor Audi models on the PPE platform will be slightly shorter than those of the current combustion engine models on MLB basis but will offer greater interior length. As is typical for electric models, there are no transmission or center tunnels. As traditional premium vehicles, the PPE models can be equipped with numerous high-end technologies: In the drive area, torque control takes place via torque vectoring, while the typical Audi features of air suspension or all-wheel steering are provided in the suspension area.\n  PPE vs MLB evo In 2020 Audi had a presentation where they discussed some of the improvments of the new platform over the MLB evo platform.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.github.io/models/e-tron/specifications/","title":"Audi e-tron specifications","tags":[],"description":"Here you find the most relevant

With a color temperature of around 5,500 Kelvin, their light resembles daylight and hardly causes any eye fatigue – especially in the dark and in the case of adverse weather conditions. In addition, LED headlights offer longer visual range than xenon headlights. In fog and precipitation, they cause the driver less glare. The LEDs are maintenance-free and designed to last the life of the car. The give the Audi models a distinctive look and strong accents with their innovative daytime and nighttime designs.\nDepending on the model the LED headlights are designed differently. In the Audi A5, for example, 26 LEDs per headlight generate all lighting functions. In each headlight, 14 LEDs work together to generate the low and high beam lights, and they are supplemented by a module for the all-weather and turning lights. A light conductor along the upper border of the headlight generates the daytime running lights, parking lights and turn signal lights. Special illumination functions are available for intersections, country roads, expressways and poor weather – and their interplay with the navigation system makes their range of performance even greater.\nHD Matrix LED headlights Matrix LED headlights produce the high beam with tiny light-emitting diodes that are bundled in common reflectors or lenses, depending on the model. With their intelligent function, they illuminate the road superbly without blinding other road users.\nWhen the light switch is set to Automatic and the high beams are on, the system is switched on outside of urban areas at speeds of 30 km/h (18.6 mph) and above. As soon as the camera on the windshield detects other vehicles or city limits, the controller switches off individual LEDs or dims them in 64 stages, creating several million possible light patterns. The Matrix LED light masks out other vehicles while continuing to fully illuminate the zones between and adjacent to them.\nThe LEDs in the Matrix LED headlights also assume the function of cornering lights, shifting the focal point of the light along the curve. This occurs shortly before the wheel is turned, based on predictive route data provided by MMI navigation plus.\nAudi introduced the next development stage of this technology, the HD Matrix LED high beam, in the A8 (D5). Each headlight integrates 32 small, individually controllable light-emitting diodes. They are arranged in two rows in a common housing. Thanks to the new configuration and to a low beam that is also variable, the HD Matrix LED headlights illuminate the road particularly dynamically and precisely.\nHD Matrix LED lights is installed on all e-trons, but you need to buy an option to active it. This can also be done trough myAudiApp as function on demand.\nSee video below how HD Matrix works on an e-tron\n  Digital matrix LED headlights With the digital matrix LED headlights as top-of-the range equipment, Audi presents a worldwide first in a production vehicle: Broken down into minute pixels, their light can illuminate the road in high resolution. The design is based on a technology abbreviated as DMD (digital micromirror device) and is also used in many video projectors. At its heart is a small chip containing one million micromirrors, each of whose edge length measures just a few hundredths of a millimeter. With the help of electrostatic fields, each individual micromirror can be tilted up to 5,000 times per second. Depending on the setting, the LED light is either directed via the lenses onto the road or is absorbed in order to mask out areas of the light beam.\nIn the Audi e-tron Sportback, the digital light that will expand the offering in mid-2020, performs multiple tasks. It can generate dynamic leaving- and coming-home animations that appear as projections on a wall or on the ground. This presentation transforms the area in front of the car into a carefully illuminated stage. Not only does the digital light system deliver cornering, city, and highway lighting as versions of the low-beam light with exceptional precision, it also supplements the high-beam light by masking out other road users with even greater accuracy. Above all, however, it offers innovative functions such as lane light and orientation light. On freeways, the lane light creates a carpet of light that illuminates the driver’s own lane brightly and adjusts dynamically when he or she changes lane. In this way, it improves the driver’s awareness of the relevant lane and contributes to improved road safety. In addition, the orientation light uses darkened areas masked out from the light beam to predictively show the vehicle’s position in the lane, thereby supporting—especially on narrow roads or in highway construction zones—the safe lane centering assist. The marking light function is also used in conjunction with the optional night vision assist. The light automatically draws attention to any pedestrians it detects, thereby reducing the danger of overlooking pedestrians in the immediate vicinity of the lane.\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.github.io/models/q4-e-tron/","title":"Audi q4 e-tron","tags":[],"description":"Q4 e-tron and Q4 e-tron Sportback is the third all-electric model from Audi.","content":"It is based on the MEB platform as Skoda Enyaq and Volkswagen ID4 and ID3.\nThe world premiere was April 14. 2021.\nSee World premiere    Audi Q4 e-tron variants Audi e-tron 55 was the first variant of Audi e-tron. e-tron 50, e-tron 55 e-tron 60S, e-tron 50 Sportback, e-tron 55 Sportback and e-tron 60S Sportback was later added\n  Audi Q4 e-tron specifications Here you find the most relevant specifications for the different Q4 e-tron variants\n  Audi Q4 e-tron dimensions Where you find the most relevant dimensions for the different variants\n  Audi Q4 e-tron exterior Audi Q4 e-tron comes in different styling, colors and wheels\n  Audi Q4 e-tron reviews Here you find different reviews of Audi Q4 e-tron\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.github.io/models/e-tron/interior/styling/","title":"Audi e-tron interior styling","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron have serveral interior styling options","content":"Glas buttons Inlays Interior lights You can add interior lights to the car.

The wheel brakes are actuated hydraulically, the reinforcement is actuated electrically, and the activation is actuated electronically. The control unit detects with how much force the driver is depressing the brake pedal and calculates how much braking torque is needed within milliseconds. If the recuperation torque is not sufficient, hydraulic pressure for the conventional friction brake is generated in addition. Put into motion by an electric spindle drive, the displacement piston pushes the brake fluid into the brake lines. The transition from the engine brake to the pure friction brake is smooth, and the driver does not notice it. A second piston generates the familiar pedal feeling for the driver’s foot by means of a pressure-resistant element. Thanks to this brake pedal simulator, the driver is not affected by what is happening in the hydraulics. In the case of ABS braking, pressure buildup and reduction are not noticeable in the form of irritating hard pulsations.\nThe electrohydraulic brake system is activated when the driver depresses the left-hand pedal so hard that the deceleration exceeds 0.3 g; otherwise, the Audi e-tron decelerates through recuperation via the two electric motors. The brake control system build up brake pressure for the wheel brakes with great precision and roughly twice as fast as a conventional system. When automated emergency braking is performed, there are only 150 milliseconds between the initiation of the brake application and the presence of maximum brake pressure between the pads and disks. This is barely more than a blink of the eye and creates impressively short braking distances. Even at a very slow speed, such as during maneuvering, the car decelerates via the wheel brakes because this is more efficient than electric braking in this case. Otherwise, the electric motor would have to use valuable battery current to decelerate actively at low rotational speeds.\nThe “brake-by-wire” technology of the electrohydraulically integrated brake control system enables a larger air gap, i.e. a greater distance between the brake pad and brake disk, to be set. This minimizes possible friction and heat generation and contributes actively to the vehicle’s long range.\nRecupoperation      "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.github.io/models/e-tron/drivetrain/motor/","title":"Audi e-tron motor","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron have two different variants of the battery","content":"him-doerr-34824a163/).\nThey have designed two induction motors (asynchronous motors)\nAudi e-tron 50 quattro, e-tron 55 quattro and e-tron S uses the same motors but in different configuration\nIt is one with 247Nm torque called 250 and one with 314Nm torque called 320.
