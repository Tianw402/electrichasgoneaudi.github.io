It is based on NMC 622 technology\nUPDATE AUGUST 2020: AUDI has from August 2020 started using Samung Prismatic cells also in some E-55. Currently we dont how this will affect performance\nEach module weighs aprox 13kg.\nEach cell is on 60ah and is 3.67 volt In each module the cells are grouped in 4 cells.
