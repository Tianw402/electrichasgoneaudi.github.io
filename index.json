They receive and transmit audio, LTE, Bluetooth, and GPS signals; the fully electric gran turismo is connected in many different ways.\nFast data transfer: MMI navigation plus The e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT come as standard with the MMI navigation plus information center, which supports the high-speed data transmission standard LTE Advanced and includes a Wi-Fi hotspot for the passengers’ mobile devices. The navigation system makes destination suggestions based on previous routes and provides lane-specific information on the traffic flow. The route is calculated both in the car and online on the servers of service provider HERE. It uses real-time data on the overall traffic situation, which enables predictive planning.\nThe Audi connect online services are split into two packages. The Audi connect navigation \u0026amp; infotainment package includes services such as traffic information online, navigation with Google Earth™, online radio, hybrid radio, and the Amazon Alexa voice assistant, which allows access to several thousands of Alexa skills. Car-to-X services can warn the driver about hazards such as road ice and help them to find free parking spots on the roadside or allow them to surf the green wave by communicating with traffic lights.\nIntelligent calculation: the e-tron route planner The e-tron route planner – yet another service from Audi connect – calculates the fastest route with the shortest possible charging stops. While doing so, it calculates the overall travel time, i.e. the driving time and the charging time, and takes forecasts regarding the traffic situation and availability of charging points into account. In any case, it plans the sections between the charging stops such that the driver arrives at their destination as quickly as possible. To do this, it may suggest charging twice with high power instead of one long stop with lower power. The directory of charging points is updated every day.\nThe second area of the service program includes Audi connect emergency call \u0026amp; service with Audi connect remote \u0026amp; control. Here, the customer can control many functions via the myAudi app on their smartphone. Aside from charging and climate control, these functions include querying the vehicle status, the car finder, or locking and unlocking. Services such as Audi connect emergency call, online roadside assistance, and Audi service request complement the portfolio.\nAttractive hardware modules supplement the infotainment portfolio. The Audi phone box (optional for both models) links smartphones to the vehicle’s antenna and charges them inductively. The Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen premium sound system (standard in the RS model ) ups the ante with an output of 710 watts. Among its 16 loudspeakers are two 3D loudspeakers in the A-pillars.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/mmi/","title":"Audi MMI","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron is equipped with the latest evolution stage of its MMI operating concepts with the MMI touch response.","content":"The Audi MMI® (Multi Media Interface) system was created to streamline the controls for audio, vehicle settings, and available navigation under a common interface, thereby reducing the number of buttons for a cleaner interior appearance.\nFollowing the premiere in the fourth generation of the Audi A8 (2017) it is now being incorporated into other model lines like Audi e-tron. The central element is the 10.1-inch touch display in black panel technology. When not in use, the screen blends almost invisibly into the high-gloss black faceplate of the instrument panel. When starting the system, the user interface appears with its concise graphics. With a resolution of 1,540 x 720 pixels, the TFT screen provides pin-sharp images and high contrast, even when viewed from an angle. The large display is used for controlling navigation, media and vehicle functions. The driver can click, swipe, zoom and scroll on it. The menu structure including the search functions is intuitive and flat, like that of a modern smartphone.\nThe key strength of the MMI touch response technology is its haptic feedback. When a finger touches the display glass, it does not immediately activate a function – a gentle push with a defined pressure is required to do that. The mechanical pulse that the driver feels as confirmation feedback is created by an electromagnet that shifts the spring-mounted display very slightly sideways – by roughly the width of a human hair. At the same time a small loudspeaker emits a click sound.\nClever detailed solutions make using the new technology even more attractive. If a finger touches an icon, the software confirms either by an animation or a change in color. If the finger pushes so hard that it triggers the function, the icon or list entry lights up briefly. Similar to on a smartphone, many symbols are supported by long-touch and long-push functions. That allows the driver to reposition a tile, for instance.\nA second display on the console of the center tunnel is used to operate the air conditioning system and convenience features. The driver can save preferred functions as favorites. The display has an 8.6-inch diagonal and a screen resolution of 1,280 x 660 pixels.\nSince the driver’s wrist rests on the transmission’s gear selector knob, the display can be operated very comfortably. The driver can also enter text – either via a digital keyboard (when the vehicle is stationary) or by innovative handwriting recognition which can recognize entire words in handwriting as well as letters handwritten on top of one another. Audible feedback is given for each recognized letter, so that the driver can always keep his or her eyes focused on the road.\nThe surfaces of the two displays have a type of anti-fingerprint coating. This makes it easy to wipe off fingerprints. There is also an anti-glare layer that refracts the reflected light. This blurs the reflections so they do not distract the driver. The top layer is toughened, making it very sturdy and scratch-resistant.\nMenu overvierw The following document presents the full menu overview\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/mmi/","title":"Audi MMI","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron is equipped with MMI touch.","content":"The Audi MMI® (Multi Media Interface) system was created to streamline the controls for audio, vehicle settings, and available navigation under a common interface, thereby reducing the number of buttons for a cleaner interior appearance.\nMMI Touch Audi Q4 e-tron comes with MMI Touch as standard.

The electrolyte carries the positively charged lithium ions from the Anode to the Cathode.\nThis reaction in Anode is called reduction and the anode is known as the reducing agent because it loses lithium atoms.\nThe Cathode is known as the oxidizing agent because it accepts lithium-ions from the anode.\nWhen the Anode release positive Lithium-ions, at the same time it frees electrons from the lithium atoms of the electrode.\nThese free electrons congregate inside the anode. As a result, the two electrodes have different charges:\nThe anode becomes negatively charged as electrons are released, and the cathode becomes positively charged as positive lithium-ions are consumed.\nThis difference in charge causes the electrons to want to move toward the positively charged cathode. However, they don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to get there inside the battery because the separator prevents them from doing so. The charge is measured in volt and depends on the chemistry used. A typical Lithium-ion cell has a charge between 3.6 - 4.2 volts depending on the state of charge (SOC).\nIn an EV we can take advantage of that desire for the electrons to re-unite with the positive lithium-ions in the cathode. If we create an external circuit through an electric motor or another electronic component we can the flow of electrons drive the motor.\nThe current collectors work as an electrical conductor between the electrode and external circuits.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/drivingassistance/collisionavoidanceassist/","title":"Collision avoidance assist","tags":[],"description":"Collision avoidance assist helps the driver steer around an obstacle in a critical situation.","content":"The system uses data from the two radar sensors and the front camera for this purpose.

The Audi pre sense front and Audi pre sense basic safety systems as well as the lane departure warning system and cruise control system are standard features.","content":"The optional systems are subdivided into the “Tour” (PCC), “City,” and “Park” (PCV) packages, which are combined in the assist system plus. The night vision assist and surround view cameras, which offer a choice of different views, are available as additional individual options. They are also available in the “Park” package.\nThe most important system in the “Tour” assist package is adaptive cruise assist, which combines the functions of adaptive cruise control, traffic jam assist, and active lane assist. It can largely take over longitudinal and lateral guidance for the driver in many situations. In order to maintain the latter, the driver needs to move the steering wheel slightly at certain intervals. When the predictive efficiency assist (standard) is active, the adaptive cruise assist decelerates and accelerates the Audi e-tron GT in such a way that it consumes as little energy as possible. To do so, it evaluates information from the onboard sensors and navigation data, provided that route guidance is active. The “Tour” assist package includes further systems in addition: camera-based traffic sign recognition and the emergency assist, as well as the turn assist and collision avoidance assist, which can prevent collisions with other vehicles.\nGet out and let the car park itself: (remote) park assist plus Aside from the maneuver assist, the (remote) park assist plus, which the driver activates at the push of a button, is one of the highlights of the “Park” assist package. It detects suitable parking spaces and can maneuver the Audi e-tron GT into and out of a parallel or bay parking space at the push of a button. The driver is responsible for the maneuver. They can remain inside the car or get out beforehand – in this case, they start and supervise the parking maneuver via the myAudi app. By keeping the corresponding button pressed, the e-tron GT will roll into the space, in multiple maneuvers if necessary. Once it has reached its final position, it switches off the drive, activates the parking lock, and locks the doors. The “City” assist package includes the following safety systems: Audi pre sense rear, side assist, exit warning, intersection assist, and rear cross-traffic assist.\nAll systems use the central driver assistance controller (zFAS), which uses the sensors’ data to continuously compute an exact model of the vehicle’s environment. This way, they can react precisely and promptly to objects, such as by initiating braking. Depending on the selected options, the zFAS receives the data to do this from up to five radar sensors, five visual cameras, the thermal imaging camera for the night vision assist, and 12 ultrasound sensors.\n   System Available     360 degree cameras option (PCZ)   Active Lane assist standard (6I3)   Adaptive Cruise Assist option (PCC)   Adaptive Cruise Control with speed limiter standard   Crossing/Intersection assist Option (PCM)   Cruise control standard   Hold Assist Standard   Park Assist Option   Pre Sense Basic option   Pre Sense front standard   Pre Sense rear option (PCM)   Pre Sense side N/A   Distance warning standard   Night Vision option (9R1)   Speed limiter standard   Park assist Plus option (PCV)   Cross traffic assist rear option (PCM)   Exit warning option (PYU)   Collision avoidance assist standard   Side assist option (PCM)   Reversing camera option (KA2)   Turn assist Option   Traffic sign recognition standard    See detailed information about the systems below.\n 360 degree cameras The four 360 degree cameras on the vehicle scan the immediate vicinity and display obstacles within.

In the table below you see the total buffer for all e-electric models from Audi.\n   Model Battery Buffer Avaiable     e-tron 55/S 95 kWh 8.5kWh (9%) 86.5 kWh   e-tron 50 71 kWh 6.3kWh (8.9%) 64.7 kWh   (RS) e-tron GT 93.4 kWh 9.7kWh (10.4%%) 83.7 kWh   Q4 e-tron 40/45/50 82 kWh 5.4kWh (6.6%) 76.6 kWh   Q4 e-tron 35 55 kWh 3kWh (5.45%) 52 kWh    But many people believe this buffer protects it against charging to 100%. But in most cases, all or almost all buffer is on the bottom to protect the battery from running empty.\nSo even e-tron 55 has a relatively large buffer, charging to 100% is not good for the battery. Audi recommends not to charge more than 80% on daily basis. This is shown in the MMI and the user manual.\nThe graph below shows a generalized stress level depending on the charge level.\nBased on this the optimal is probably to keep it between 30 and 70%, but how much better it is compared to just charge to 100% is impossible to know.\nThe buffers are in reality limits on the max and minimum voltage each cell can have. Having a 4% buffer on top means the voltage on each cell is limited to a max of 96% of the max voltage.\nNumber of charge cycles The number of charge cycles affects the degradation.\nThe diagram below shows hows the battery degrade based on charging habits. Based on this, the best is to keep the charging levels around 50%.\nHigh Temperature High temperatures hurt the battery. If you live in an area with high temperatures, you should try to avoid having the car parked in the heating sun all day.\nYou can find more about degradation in our battery guide.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/comparisons/q4etron50vsetron55/","title":"Q4 e-tron 50 quattro vs e-tron 55 quattro","tags":[],"description":"Here you find a detailed comparison between Audi Q4 e-tron 50 Quattro and Audi e-tron 55.","content":"For many buyers this is a real dilemma.

This guide explains how.","content":"When the battery degrades the available battery capacity reduces. This causes a shorter range.\nIf you know how much net capacity your car should have, you can easily check it.\nThis is how you check your battery\n Charge to 100% Take a drive and at least spend 70% of the battery. Try to keep the consumption low. Take a note of your consumption and driving distance Take a note of end SOC (state of charge) (percent left on battery) Calculate actual capacity  For the following examples, we assume you have an e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh net capacity from the factory.\nCalculation in miles Miles example 1 You drive 169 miles with consumption of 2.6 miles/kWh. You started the trip with 100% battery and ended up with 21%.\nFirst, you calculate the total energy used: 169/2.6 = 65kWh in total.\nIf you had 21% left, you have used 79%. (100%-21%)\nThe current capacity is that 79% = 65kWh.\nThe full capacity (100%) can then be calculated:\n(65/79)*100 = 82.27kWh.\n82.27 is the actual capacity of your battery.\n82.27/86.5 = 95.1%. Meaning a reduction of almost 5% from the original capacity.\nCalculation in kilometers Km example 1 If you drive 240 kilometers with a consumption of 25kWh/100 You started with 100% and ended up with 16%.\nFirst, you calculate the total energy used\n(280 * 25)/100 = 70kWh in total on the trip.\nIf you have 16% left you have used 84% on the trip (100-16)\n84% = 70kWh battery.\nThe full capacity (100%) can then be calculated:\n(70/84)*100 = 83.333 kWh\n83.333 is the actual capacity of your battery.\n83.33/86.5 = 96.34%. Meaning a reduction of almost 4% from the original capacity.\nWhat affects capacity Just one deviation from capacity does not necessarily mean that your battery has degraded.\nIf you have high consumption there will be some loss because of internal resistance.\nIf your battery was unbalanced it will also affect the battery capacity.\nFor the people that love to keep track of this, we recommend tracking this from the beginning of ownership. In this way you will know your car more.\nThe following example show the stats from an e-tron 55 2020v1 with 83.6kWh capacity from it was new.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/","title":"Audi e-tron GT","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT is the second all-electric model from Audi.

To reduce the dependencies to cobolt different chemistries are used.\nLithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides is the most common chemistry on EV\u0026rsquo;s today.\nThe metal ratio varies. The versions was NMC 111, then NMC 622 was the common followed by NCM 711. Many vendors are working on providing cells with 811 metal ratio.\nLithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (NCA) Lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (NCA) are used by Panasonic.\nLithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) Lithium iron phosphate battery\nSeperator A separator is a permeable membrane placed between a battery\u0026rsquo;s anode and cathode.\nElectrolyte Liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries consist of lithium salts in an organic solvent, such as ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate.\nA liquid electrolyte acts as a conductive pathway for the movement of cations passing from the negative to the positive electrodes during discharge and the opoosite direction when charging.\nElectrolytes based on solid materials are areas that many works on. These are called solid state batteries. Currently there is no concrete plans of any mass production EV with Solid state batteries.\nCurrent collector The current collector is used to provide conduction of electrons from inside the electrochemical reaction to the external part without any reaction within the operation window.\nCurrently used collectors are mostly made of aluminum or copper foils.\nCell Housing Cells for EV\u0026rsquo;s come in 3 different housings\nCylinder housing A cylindrical cell consists of sheet-like anodes, separators, and cathodes that are sandwiched, rolled up, and packed into a cylinder-shaped can. This is the form factor that has been used for years in the market.\nOne advantage is mechanical stability. The round shape of the battery distributes the internal pressure from side reactions over the cell circumference almost evenly. This allows the cell to tolerate a higher level of internal pressure without deformation.\nTesla is one of the few EV manufactors that uses this.\nPrismatic housing Li-ion cells with prismatic housing consist of large sheets of anodes, cathodes, and separators sandwiched, rolled up, and pressed to fit into a hard-plastic or metallic housing in cubic form. The electrodes can also be assembled by layer stacking rather than jelly rolling.\nParts of the electrode and separator sheets of a prismatic cell that are close to the container corners can experience more stress. This can damage electrode coating and lead to non-uniform distribution of the electrolyte.\nWhen combining prismatic cells into packs, the cell box-like shape enables optimal use of the available space. However, this optimal space is achieved at the cost of more challenging thermal management. This is because there are no space cavities between the cells as there are in a pack of cylindrical cells.\nPouch housing Pouch cells do not have a rigid enclosure like prismatic and cylinder cells and use a sealed flexible foil as the cell container.\nThis makes it the most efficient use of space and achieves a 90 to 95 percent packaging efficiency, the highest among battery packs, advantages of flexible size and safety performance. Eliminating the metal enclosure reduces weight but the cell needs some alternative support in the battery compartment.\nSwelling Pouch Cell Battery as a Result of Gas Generation During Charge and Discharge\nThe electrode and separator layers of a pouch cell are stacked rather than jelly rolled. With pouch cells, the designer should allocate enough space for the cell swelling. A swelling of as much as 8% to 10% can occur after 500 cycles.\nAudi cells The below table list the cells used on the different all-electric Audi models.

While Audi RS e-tron GT output a system performance of 645 metric hp (475 kW) and 830 Nm (612.2 lb-ft) of torque.\nThe four-door Audi RS e-tron GT is propelled from zero to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 3.3 seconds and reaches 200 km/h (124.3 mph) in just over 12 seconds, before propulsion ends at 250 km/h (155.3 mph).\nIf necessary, the Audi e-tron GT can be charged in a short space of time. The high-voltage system in J1-performance platform is designed for a voltage of 800 volts and allows the battery to be charged to 80 percent in 22.5 minutes at a DC terminal with an output of 350 kW.\nIn accordance with the WLTP standard, the Audi e-tron GT achieves a range of 472 kilometers (293.5 mi) on one battery charge.\nThe battery, which has an energy content of more than 90 kWh, is located in the underbody, between the axles. The battery package is designed with recesses in the rear footwell. This provides a high level of seating comfort for all occupants. This special layout allows the drive battery to be integrated in the vehicle floor despite the low body position that is typical for sports cars, thereby creating a very low vehicle center of gravity. At the same time, this creates comfortable seating ergonomics.\nIts lightweight design body and the optional roof made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) are built according to the principle of multi-material construction.

Fascinating design, high\u0002quality interior workmanship and a top-of-the-line operating system. The use of maximum platform synergies in the Group makes electric mobility attractive to many new customers in the compact segment. The modular electric drive platform of the Volkswagen Group is designed to be highly versatile and scalable to a high degree. Its matrix extends from SUVs and crossover models all the way to sedans.\nAs it is designed exclusively for electric drives, the MEB allows customers to experience all the advantages that compact electric motors and lithium-ion batteries in different sizes and capacities offer. The battery systems, electric motors and axle designs form a stringent technology toolkit.\nOther existing models that uses MEB in adition to Audi Q4 are\n VW ID3 VW ID4 VW ID6 Skoda Enyaq Cupra Born  In contrast to the current models with combustion engines, the front section is considerably shorter—the front axle and firewall move forward, making the wheelbase and thus the usable interior space considerably larger.\nIn March 2019, Audi announced the Q4 e-tron concept with a near-production-level showcar at the Geneva Motor Show. It will be the first Audi based on the MEB platform to roll off the line: A compact SUV that fits into the same segment as the conventionally motorized Q3. Its exterior length of 4.59 meters (15.1 ft) places it in the upper third of the compact class; thanks to its wheelbase of 2.76 meters (9.1 ft), however, its interior is at least at the level of the medium-size class.\nIn terms of interior length, each MEB model thus corresponds to a current vehicle from the next higher category. While the exterior dimensions of the Q4 e-tron concept are comparable to those of the Q3, it offers the interior dimensions of a Q5. The architecture of the dashboard also offers new design opportunities.\nOf course the MEB platform also offers different performance levels and drive layouts. In addition to the typical quattro all-wheel drive with an electric motor at the front and rear axles, there will also be a drive variant with a rear-mounted engine and rear-wheel drive for the entry\u0002level variants.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/navigation/","title":"Navigation system","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron is equipped with MMI Navigation plus that helps to navigate to the destination.","content":"The navigation system on the Audi e-tron is based on maps and data from HERE Maps.\nThe navigation system is available in the virtual cockpit, the Head up display, and Audi MMi and will help to navigate to your destination, but also will help find charging stations, parking, and other points of interestest along the route.\nYou can enable Google maps-based Satellite photos and google based search to enrich the experience even more.\n Detailed route information: map preview, choice of alternative routes, POIs, lane recommendations, motorway exits, detailed intersection maps and much more.

That is the reason they call it \u0026ldquo;one-pedal-driving\u0026rdquo;\nAudi has not made it possible to enable one pedal driving permanent. It is a little different on the different models but the principle Audi follows are the same.\nThey rather want their drivers to maximize the efficiency with coasting instead of automatic reducing speed when you lift the foot of the gas pedal.\nOne pedal driving is less efficient since you lose energy compared to coasting.\nThis is because you only get approx 80% of the kinetic energy the moving car has, back to the battery, when doing recuperation. (Assuming the traffic and road allow to coast)\nYou are also forced to have the foot on the pedal at a specific position to freeroll/coast to find the position when no energy is going out of the battery and nothing is going in.\nAudi e-tron On Audi e-tron can set recuperation to manual (MMI -\u0026gt; Vehicle -\u0026gt; Efficiency Assistant -\u0026gt; Recuperation) and then you can every time you start a drive, set recuperation to the max with the steering wheel recuperation paddles, and then it will regenerate every time you lift your foot of the \u0026ldquo;gas pedal\u0026rdquo; and works as \u0026ldquo;one-pedal-driving\u0026rdquo;.\nWith the wheel paddles, you can set the recuperation to 3 different levels. (for more or less braking). High, medium and off.\nThis is not recommended for experienced drivers. If you learn to coast you will get the best comfort and the best range. Next time it will be reset back. For drivers coming from other EV\u0026rsquo;s, this might be the way to unlearn the bad habit.\nIf you set it recuperation to automatic it will only recuperate when you are getting close to other cars or you are close to an intersection or other reasons you need to slow down. Otherwise, it will coast and save the maximum amount of energy as long you don\u0026rsquo;t press the accelerator.\nAudi Q4 e-tron On Audi Q4 e-tron you can set the car in B-mode with help of the shifter.

Porsche will use it for their upcoming Porsche Macan, while Audi will use it for Audi Q6 e-tron and A6 e-tron.\nWith its special architecture, it provides the conditions needed for ultra-modern technology that satisfies the demanding customer requests in the full-size and luxury class segments.\nPPE will take on the role in the world of electric vehicles that the modular longitudinal platform holds in vehicles powered by combustion engines. It is characterized by a high-tech and highly scalable architecture that allows both low- and high-floor vehicles to be realized.\nAudi is developing various model series on the basis of PPE that will cover the segments from the upper medium-size class to the luxury class as SUVs, Sportbacks, Avants and Crossovers with various different vehicle types. In doing so, the brand is also expanding its current model portfolio in the full-size class and luxury segments by adding numerous electric variants.\nThe technology package on the PPE is generally similar to that of the MEB; in addition, it offers great potential in terms of output and performance. As standard, the vehicles are fitted with one electric motor in the rear; the top-of-the-range models are equipped with a second electric motor at the front axle (PSM or ASM) that allows them to activate all-wheel drive automatically when needed. If will of course also be possible to realize different performance levels and battery capacities on the PPE platform. Like in the Audi e-tron GT concept, the state of charge is 800 volts; in combination with high-efficiency thermal management, it enables a high charging capacity of 350 kW.\nBattery sizes are unknown at current time, but A6 e-tron concept have 100kWh net and a range of 700 km WLTP. This will indicate a consumption on 14.2 kWh/100km that indicate a very efficient drivetrain.\nThe dimensions and overhangs of the low-floor Audi models on the PPE platform will be slightly shorter than those of the current combustion engine models on MLB basis but will offer greater interior length. As is typical for electric models, there are no transmission or center tunnels. As traditional premium vehicles, the PPE models can be equipped with numerous high-end technologies: In the drive area, torque control takes place via torque vectoring, while the typical Audi features of air suspension or all-wheel steering are provided in the suspension area.\n  PPE vs MLB evo In 2020 Audi had a presentation where they discussed some of the improvments of the new platform over the MLB evo platform.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/specifications/","title":"Audi e-tron GT specifications","tags":[],"description":"Here you find the most relevant specifications for the different e-tron GT variants.

The human eye perceives the information extremely quickly – and there’s no need for drivers to refocus from their accustomed long-range view.\nThe image is projected onto the windshield. The information appears to hover around two meters (6.6 ft) in front of the driver within a visual window measuring 200 x 80 mm (7.9 x 3.1 in). A TFT monitor with white LED backlighting generates the color image. Two aspherical mirrors magnify and redirect the image. The mirrors also compensate for any distortions due to the curvature of the windshield.

The information provided by some of the assist systems and the turning arrows of the navigation system as well as its starting points and destinations are visually superimposed in the corresponding place on the real-life outside world as content of the AR section and displayed dynamically. They appear to be floating at a distance of roughly ten meters from the driver. Depending on the situation, they can appear considerably further ahead in some cases. The driver can understand the displays very quickly without being confused or distracted by them, and they are extremely helpful in poor visibility conditions.\nThe field of view for the AR content from the driver’s perspective is equivalent to a diagonal of around 70 inches. Below it is a flat near-field area window, known as the status section. It displays the speed driven and the traffic signs as well as the assist system and navigation symbols as static displays. It appears to hover about three meters in front of the driver.\nThe heart of the system: the picture generation unit The technical heart of the augmented reality head-up display is the picture generation unit (PGU), which is located deep inside the long instrument panel. A particularly bright LCD directs the light beams it generates onto two level mirrors, and special optical components separate the portions for the near-field and distant areas. The level mirrors direct the beams onto a large concave mirror that can be adjusted electrically. From there, they reach the windshield, which reflects them into what is known as the eyebox and thus onto the driver’s eyes. At an apparent distance of ten meters, or even further away depending on the situation, the driver sees the symbols just as clearly as their real-life environment.\nPredictive picture generator: the AR Creator What is known as the AR Creator serves as the mastermind and picture generator on the software side – this is a processing unit in the modular infotainment platform (MIB 3) that is comprised of multiple individual modules. The AR Creator renders the display symbols at a rate of 60 frames per second and adapts them to the geometry of the projection optics. At the same time, it calculates their location in relation to the environment, on which it obtains information via the raw data of the front camera, the radar sensor, and the GPS navigation. Its software consists of roughly 600,000 lines of programming code, around 50 percent more than the entire control system of the first version of the Space Shuttle.\nWhile performing its computing work, the AR Creator takes into account that there are always a few fractions of a second between the identification of an object by the sensors and the output of the graphic content. During these brief time windows, the Q4 e-tron can change its position considerably, whether due to braking or a pothole. Multiple computations are performed continuously to ensure that the display in the eyebox does not jump into the wrong position. One of them takes place in the camera software. For another, the AR Creator uses the most recent data to make a predictive calculation of the car’s continued forward movement. In a further computation, it estimates the vertical movement on the basis of data supplied by the camera, the radar, and the sensors of the stabilization control (ESC). These insights are incorporated into the “shake compensation,” which takes place a few milliseconds before the picture is output and whose task is to prevent any disruptive shaking of the display.\nNavigation: the drone flies ahead The augmented reality head-up display demonstrates its strengths in a particularly impressive way during navigation. On the road, what is known as the drone – a floating arrow – shows the next point of action on the route. It is dynamic: When approaching an intersection, for example, the floating arrow first announces the turning maneuver before an animated arrow steers the driver onto the road with precision. If the route then continues straight ahead, the drone flies ahead and disappears in order to then reappear with sufficient time before the next point of action. The distance to the turning point is displayed in meters in the lower window of the near-field area.\nEven if the driver has activated the adaptive cruise assist, which keeps the car in the center of the lane, the augmented reality head-up display assists them with visual hints. As soon as the Q4 e-tron approaches a lane marking without the turn signal having been activated, the lane departure warning superimposes the real-life lane marking with a red line. Another example is regulation in relation to a vehicle driving in front: If it is active, the car is marked on the display with a colored stripe – this allows the driver to understand the status of the adaptive cruise assist or adaptive cruise control without being distracted. A red marking and a warning symbol appear if the adaptive cruise assist prompts the driver to verify that they are paying attention.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/interior/inlays/","title":"Inlays","tags":[],"description":"You can choose between different inlays","content":"The following inlays are available as standard\nGraphite Grey This is the standard inlay on Audi e-tron GT\nCarbon Paladium Silver This is the standard inlay on Audi RS e-tron GT\nValnut "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/inlays/","title":"Inlays","tags":[],"description":"You can choose between different inlays","content":"The following inlays are available as standard\nYou can also order special inlays from the Audi Exclusive collection\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/interior/lights/","title":"Interior &amp; Ambient lights","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.","content":"Standard Interior lights The following interior lights are standard on Audi Q4\n LED front and rear roof module (white) luggage compartment light, left (white) storage compartment in front centre console (white) illuminated glove compartment  Ambient lights package White lights with option id QQ8\nIn addition to the standard lights you get\n illuminated front vanity mirrors (white) ambient lighting for front and rear doors (white) entry lights on the underside of the front doors (white) contour lighting on dashboard (multicoloured) footwell lighting in the front and rear  Ambient light plus package The ambient lighting package plus with option id QQ9. offers the following range of features, some in white light, others with multiple colour adjustment:\n illuminated front vanity mirrors (white) ambient lighting for front and rear doors (multicoloured) entry lights on the underside of the front doors (white) contour lighting on dashboard (multicoloured) footwell lighting in the front and rear  The color can change based on your drive mode in Audi Drive Select.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/interior/lights/","title":"Interior &amp; ambient lights","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.","content":"Standard Interior lights The following interior lights are standard on Audi e-tron GT\n LED front and rear roof module (white) luggage compartment light, left and right (white) illuminated glove compartment Floor lightning in front/rear Makup mirror with light Ligts in door handles inside  Ambient Lighting White lights with option id QQ1 and multicolor with 30 color options per controllable area with option id QQ2.\nThe color can change based on your drive mode in Audi Drive Select.\nSee video below why this is the option to get.\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/lights/","title":"Interior &amp; ambient lights","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.","content":"Standard Interior lights The following interior lights are standard on Audi e-tron\n LED front and rear roof module (white) luggage compartment light, left and right (white) storage compartment in front centre console (white) illuminated glove compartment Floor lightning in front/rear Makup mirror with light Light in back door  Ambient light package White lights with option id QQ1 gives you\n White ambient lights in facbric areas in doors Orient lightning in outside door handles White ambient lights in center consol  Multicolor contour/ambient light pack This option with option id QQ2 gives you.\n White ambient lights in facbric areas in doors Orient lightning in outside door handles Multicolor ambient lights in center consol Multicolor contour lights in center consol Contour lightning in instrumentpanel and dashboard.

This is where the character of the electrically powered gran turismo is focused. They are three-dimensional sculptures with a dynamic character and digital aesthetics. The wedge-shaped headlights in the e-tron GT are available in three versions.\nAudi supplies them in LED technology with dynamic turn signals as standard.\nThe matrix LED headlights are also available as an alternative; these come as standard with the RS e-tron GT. Their continuous high beams can shine with maximum brightness without blinding other road users. Option ID 8G4\nTopping the range are the matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light. In the center of the headlights, between the low beam and high beam modules, there is a laser spot that is activated from a speed of 70 km/h (43.5 mph) and doubles the range of the high beam. It is framed by an X-shaped trim with expressive design that is a small work of art in itself. Its lower section consists of free-standing elements with edges illuminated in blue. The central wings of the daytime running light signature forms the upper part of the “X.” The daytime running light signature itself has a dual function as a turn signal and consists of a row of sharp angles that give it a digital look. Option ID PXC\nA sculpted light strip spans the entire width of the rear end of the e-tron GT. It transitions dynamically into arrow segments that increase in size toward the outside, thereby creating an unmistakable, lean tail light signature. Independently of the headlight configuration, the rear lights are fitted entirely with LEDs and dynamic turn signals that spreads out flat under the tail light signature. The brake light is located below, in a low and dark area.\nComing home and leaving home animation: character made visible The top-of-the-line headlights offer another characteristic feature: coming home and leaving home animations at the front and rear. The leaving home sequence, which is activated when the doors are unlocked, is inspired by the power of a sound wave: The illumination of the individual elements builds up quickly and strongly, then retreats briefly before going all in the second time. With the RS model, the animations are even more dynamic.\nThis animation shows the lighting technology including Matrix LED headlights with laser as additional high beam in the Audi e-tron GT.    "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/technology/lights/","title":"Audi e-tron lights technology","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has a lot of lightning options","content":"LED headlights Along with their high level of efficiency, LED headlights also offer significant benefits in terms of safety and comfort. With a color temperature of around 5,500 Kelvin, their light resembles daylight and hardly causes any eye fatigue – especially in the dark and in the case of adverse weather conditions. In addition, LED headlights offer longer visual range than xenon headlights. In fog and precipitation, they cause the driver less glare. The LEDs are maintenance-free and designed to last the life of the car. The give the Audi models a distinctive look and strong accents with their innovative daytime and nighttime designs.\nDepending on the model the LED headlights are designed differently. In the Audi A5, for example, 26 LEDs per headlight generate all lighting functions. In each headlight, 14 LEDs work together to generate the low and high beam lights, and they are supplemented by a module for the all-weather and turning lights. A light conductor along the upper border of the headlight generates the daytime running lights, parking lights and turn signal lights. Special illumination functions are available for intersections, country roads, expressways and poor weather – and their interplay with the navigation system makes their range of performance even greater.\nHD Matrix LED headlights Matrix LED headlights produce the high beam with tiny light-emitting diodes that are bundled in common reflectors or lenses, depending on the model. With their intelligent function, they illuminate the road superbly without blinding other road users.\nWhen the light switch is set to Automatic and the high beams are on, the system is switched on outside of urban areas at speeds of 30 km/h (18.6 mph) and above. As soon as the camera on the windshield detects other vehicles or city limits, the controller switches off individual LEDs or dims them in 64 stages, creating several million possible light patterns. The Matrix LED light masks out other vehicles while continuing to fully illuminate the zones between and adjacent to them.\nThe LEDs in the Matrix LED headlights also assume the function of cornering lights, shifting the focal point of the light along the curve. This occurs shortly before the wheel is turned, based on predictive route data provided by MMI navigation plus.\nAudi introduced the next development stage of this technology, the HD Matrix LED high beam, in the A8 (D5). Each headlight integrates 32 small, individually controllable light-emitting diodes. They are arranged in two rows in a common housing. Thanks to the new configuration and to a low beam that is also variable, the HD Matrix LED headlights illuminate the road particularly dynamically and precisely.\nHD Matrix LED lights is installed on all e-trons, but you need to buy an option to active it. The optionId is PX6\nIf you dont buy this option when ordering the car you can also buy it as function on demand from the myAudi app. Note it requires two packages to get the full matrix experience as described above. The HD Matrix and Light Function package.\nSee video below how HD Matrix works on an e-tron\n  Digital matrix LED headlights With the digital matrix LED headlights as top-of-the range equipment, Audi presents a worldwide first in a production vehicle: Broken down into minute pixels, their light can illuminate the road in high resolution. The design is based on a technology abbreviated as DMD (digital micromirror device) and is also used in many video projectors. At its heart is a small chip containing one million micromirrors, each of whose edge length measures just a few hundredths of a millimeter. With the help of electrostatic fields, each individual micromirror can be tilted up to 5,000 times per second. Depending on the setting, the LED light is either directed via the lenses onto the road or is absorbed in order to mask out areas of the light beam.\nIn the Audi e-tron Sportback, the digital light that will expand the offering in mid-2020, performs multiple tasks. It can generate dynamic leaving- and coming-home animations that appear as projections on a wall or on the ground. This presentation transforms the area in front of the car into a carefully illuminated stage. Not only does the digital light system deliver cornering, city, and highway lighting as versions of the low-beam light with exceptional precision, it also supplements the high-beam light by masking out other road users with even greater accuracy. Above all, however, it offers innovative functions such as lane light and orientation light. On freeways, the lane light creates a carpet of light that illuminates the driver’s own lane brightly and adjusts dynamically when he or she changes lane. In this way, it improves the driver’s awareness of the relevant lane and contributes to improved road safety. In addition, the orientation light uses darkened areas masked out from the light beam to predictively show the vehicle’s position in the lane, thereby supporting—especially on narrow roads or in highway construction zones—the safe lane centering assist. The marking light function is also used in conjunction with the optional night vision assist. The light automatically draws attention to any pedestrians it detects, thereby reducing the danger of overlooking pedestrians in the immediate vicinity of the lane.\nThe optionID is PXC for Digital matrix LED Headlights.\n Entry Lights You can order e-tron entry lights option id 9TF\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/technology/lights/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron light technology","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron has advanced lightning options","content":"The headlights There is two types of headlights available on Audi Q4 e-tron\nStandard headlights The headlights of the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron are fully equipped with LEDs as standard.\nThe standard headlights does not include high-beam assistant or head light washers.\nHigh beam assistant has option id 8G1 and head light washers has option id 8X8\nMatrix Headlights On request, Audi also offers the Matrix LED headlights – they lend the two electric compact SUVs a look that is full of character and unmistakable, day and night. The next stage of evolution in daytime running lights is totally new among the competition. Using the MMI touch operating system, the driver can switch between four digital light signatures at any time. Each of them generates its own theme and lends the daytime running lights an individual expression. The variant selected is activated the next time the vehicle is started. The below show the 4 different signatures\nThe vide below show more details\n  The Matrix LED headlights are divided into two sections in terms of optics and technology. The completely black lower half conceals the units for the low beam and the Matrix LED high beam. The 16 individual LEDs that comprise it are regulated so that they always illuminate the road as brightly as possible without blinding other road users.\nThe upper half forms a bright eye. A flat segment runs across the headlights here, serving a dual function in generating a fixed daytime running light and the dynamic turn signals. Above and below it are a total of nine flat daytime running light segments, which, together with the large vertical anchor segment at the outer edge, can be configured into four digital light signatures. Two slat trims made of brushed stainless steel divide the digital daytime running light segments into 49 small sections. Seen from the side, they appear to be well shielded, lying one on top of the other like the slats of vertical blinds; the full power of the individual light segments is easily visible from the front – creating a fascinating effect that plays with light and shadows.\nSee video below how HD Matrix works on an e-tron\n  Striking taillight signature: the light strip at the rear In combination with the Matrix LED headlights, there is also a particularly elegant light solution at the rear of the compact electric SUV. A light strip runs across its full width; at its center the taillight beams out in a fine line that splits into separate segments at its ends. Each individual segment is modeled as a three-dimensional body, resulting in a light sculpture that is expressive from all perspectives. The light signature opens up into a large light anchor segment on the sides of the vehicle. Its dynamic graphic is inspired by intricate electric circuits and bears the Four Rings radiating in signature red as the central detail. The dynamic turn signals add a further highlight in the reversing lights.\nWhen the car is unlocked and exited, dynamic “leaving home” and “coming home” light sequences are played in the rear lights and the headlights. The sequences in the headlights vary depending on which daytime running light signature is selected.\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/s-line/","title":"S-line exterior package","tags":[],"description":"The S-line exterior package contains additional styling elements.","content":"The more distinctively contoured bumper is flanked by more expressive air curtains painted in silver.\nIn addition, the Single frame grill has a shadow look compared with the standard that has a silver look.\nThe rear diffusor have a more sporty and dynamic look.\nElements on the door is in silver compared to standard that has body color or contrast color for standard.

In this guide, we explain what affects the range of your all-electric Audi and why you don&#39;t see the range as expected.","content":"The range of electric cars is typically given as a WLTP range (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure) in Europe or EPA in the US.\nBelow you see the range of the different current and some future Audi models. The range is from 341km (211 miles) to 700km (435 miles) according to the WLTP combined standard.\nThe most important aspect of range is of course how large the battery is. A larger battery means more energy to use.\nThe below chart shows the available battery size for the different models.\nBut the battery is not the only factor in the stated range. Another important factor is how efficient the car is.\nAnd with efficiency, it means how much energy is used from the battery for a given distance. In Europe, it is typical stated as kWh/100km meaning how many kWh is needed to drive 100km. In the US and the UK, it is rated as miles per kWh, meaning how far can you go with 1 kWh.\nThe below diagram shows the calculated consumption in kWh/100km for the different all-electric models is according to WLTP combined rating.\nWhat affects the WLTP consumption? The efficiency or WLTP consumption is affected by many attributes of the car.\nAerodynamic drag The aerodynamic drag affects how much energy is needed to move. The shape of the body affects it but also the design of the wheels.\nAudi A6 e-tron concept is currently the model with the lowest drag coefficient with a Cw value on only 0.22\nRolling resistance The rolling resistance sometimes called rolling friction or rolling drag is the force resisting the motion when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface.\nThis is affected by the width of the tires, the weight of the car, the tire compound, and the tire pressure.\nAudi RS e-tron GT has very wide tires with 285mm to get the best traction. This increases rolling resistance. As an option, you can get 305mm wide tires that increase traction and decreases range.\nSome tire producers have started producing specific tires for EV with low rolling resistance that affect range.\nAudi delivers these types of tires on some of the models. See below for a very good and detailed test that describes the difference between EV optimized tires and regular.\n  Weight A heavier car requires more energy to move.\nThe efficiency of the drivetrain/motors Electric motors are very efficient by default, but there are still some different technologies that give different consumption based on the setup.\nPermanently excited synchronous use less energy in use but have higher coasting resistance. Induction motors use a little more energy to move but have almost zero coasting resistance.\nNewer cars often combine these two techniques having a rear synchronous motor always in use and an induction motor in front. Example Audi Q4 e-tron quattro 50.\nAudi is working on the new PPE platform and already now we know that this drivetrain will have a improved effiency\nThe internal resistance of the battery The internal resistance in the battery causes heat loss in the battery.\nFactors vary based on selected options Many of the above factors are fixed. Like the e-tron Sportback has less drag than the e-tron SUV because of the body shape.\nBut other factors are affected by the equipment you add to your car. If you buy wider tires, you will get a higher consumption and then a shorter range.\nThe below diagram shows hows adding the max options of the car increase the WLTP consumption.\nFrom the diagram, you can see that an Audi e-tron 55 has a consumption of 19.61 kWh/100km in the basic trim, but 23.44 kWh/100km in the top trim. Reducing the range from 441km (274 miles) to 369km (229 miles).\nWhat affects the real-world consumption In the real world, it is almost impossible to get the same range as given by WLTP or EPA. This is because that range is based on ideal driving conditions with specific behavior.\nRoad condition Road conditions are one of the factors that affect consumption. If it is dry tarmac the rolling resistance is much lower than if the road is wet or is packed with snow.\nThe speed High speed increases the consumption because of higher drag.\nThe temperature The temperature affects the range in different ways. If it is cold the air is denser and it is a higher aerodynamical drag.\nIn addition, warm and cold weather could increase the consumption of air condition system in the car.\nThe driving style You as a driver can improve range a lot.\n Look ahead and coast as much as possible When needing to reduce speed, start reducing when possible so early that you only use recuperation.  How does the range indicator work on electric Audi The range indicator on all-electric Audis is much more advanced than many other brands.\nWhile some brands show the same range no matter what and ignore the driving condition or the driving style to the owner, all-electric Audis tries to learn from previous trips and this causes a lot of questions about range from owners since range varies and drops when driving condition worsens.\nBelow you see some typical questions.\nSo how does the range indicator works?\nThe range indicator base its range on the following data\n Average consumption on the latest trips The state of charge (of much is the battery charged) The planned route in the navigation system  So assume you have an e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh battery and you have charged it to 100%.\nIf your average consumption was 25kWh/100 on the previous trips, the range indicator, or GOM (guessometer) that many calls it would calculate you would have a range on 346km. If your average consumption was 20kWh/100km it would calculate 432km. And if you are one that likes speed and had an average of 30kWh/100 km your calculated range would be 288km.\nBut this is the best guess based on previous trips. If you change behavior on the next trip, the range calculated would be wrong.\nIf you have done many short trips in cold weather, you would have spent lots of energy to heat up the car. But this average consumption is not relevant if you the next day are taking a long drive. The car would then underestimate the range.\nIf a route is defined in the car navigation system the car would adjust range based on elevation and road ahead.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/virtualcockpit/","title":"Virtual Cockpit","tags":[],"description":"The Audi virtual cockpit is a fully digital instrument cluster with a 12.3-inch TFT screen.","content":"The virtual cockpit display has a full HD resolution of 1,920 x 720 pixels.

The driver operates the free-standing Audi virtual cockpit plus via the multifunction buttons on the spokes of the steering wheel. The display measures 12.3 inches in the diagonal and offers a high resolution of 1,920 x 720 pixels. The driver can switch between the “classic,” “sport,” and “e-tron” screens in the MMI operating system. In the e-tron view, the focus is on the large power meter that displays the status of the drive and all important information on electric driving.\nThe central MMI touch display (10.1 inches) is controlled via touch and provides acoustic feedback. This is where the driver manages the infotainment, navigation, comfort functions, and text input. The menu structure is lean and clear, just as on a smartphone, and the MMI search is based on free input. For many searches, the hit list will appear after entering a couple of letters.\n“Hey Audi:” natural language control The third control level is the natural language control which understands numerous expressions from everyday language. It draws information for its responses to commands and questions not only from the information stored on board but also from the cloud. While the onboard information is available particularly quickly, the online information is more extensive. Natural language control can be activated with the wake-up words “Hey Audi.”\nThe optional head-up display can display important information on the windshield. The image window is in the driver’s field of vision, with the projection appearing to float about two meters in front of them. Another convenient feature of the Audi e-tron GT is the personalization: Up to six users – five fixed users and one guest – can each store hundreds of preferred settings in individual profiles. The car adjusts the preferred settings when the driver’s door is opened.\nBehind the control and display functions in the e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT is the third-generation modular infotainment toolkit (MIB 3), which offers extremely high processing power. It works with the physically separate communication box, which executes all tasks relating to connectivity at great speed, and has an integrated Wi-Fi hotspot. After the vehicle is started, the MIB 3 with all of its functions, apps, and services boots up within a few seconds. The driver can activate an individual dashboard that displays up to three main applications in separate windows.\n   Audi MMI Audi e-tron GT is equipped with the latest evolution stage of its MMI operating concepts with the MMI touch response.\n  Virtual Cockpit The Audi virtual cockpit is a fully digital instrument cluster with a 12.3-inch TFT screen.\n  Heads up display Audi e-tron GT can be equipped with heads up display\n  Smartphone Interface With the Smartphone Interface option you expand your smartphone in to the MMI system\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/","title":"User interface and operations","tags":[],"description":"The user interface and operations are seperated in separate areas in the Audi e-tron.","content":" Audi MMI Audi e-tron is equipped with the latest evolution stage of its MMI operating concepts with the MMI touch response.\n  Navigation system Audi e-tron is equipped with MMI Navigation plus that helps to navigate to the destination.\n  Virtual Cockpit The Audi virtual cockpit is a fully digital instrument cluster with a 12.3-inch TFT screen.\n  Head-up display Audi e-tron can be equipped with head-up-display\n  Smartphone Interface With the Smartphone Interface option you expand your smartphone in to the MMI system\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/exterior/optics/","title":"Optics &amp; Grill","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT has some different options for optics and single frame grill","content":"Optics Standard optics This is the optics that is standard on Audi e-tron GT.

However, the high-voltage battery charge level is only 96 %. Balancing means that this cell is now discharged via a resistor and can thereby continue to be charged until all cells have reached the same charge level. This allows the high-voltage battery to achieve its maximum capacitance.\nTo do this, the battery regulation control unit compares the voltages of the cell groups. If cell groups have a high cell voltage, the battery modules control unit responsible receives the balancing information. Balancing is performed when voltage differences of greater than approx. 1% occur when the high-voltage battery is being charged. After the ignition has been switched off, the battery regulation control unit checks whether balancing is necessary and triggers it if necessary. Typical balancing is performed at charge levels greater than 30%.\nOn all-electric Audis it is not possible to check the cell balance without extra tools. ODBEleven is one of these tools that can be used. The below screenshot show that one cell set has 10% SOC and another has 13% soc. Audi e-tron has 108 cell sets with 3 or 4 cells in parallel depending on version.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/interior/","title":"Audi e-tron GT interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT has a luxury interior with different options in seats and design.","content":"The interior of the e-tron GT conveys the ultimate gran turismo feel by radiating sportiness, comfort, and expanse in equal measure. Sustainable materials also play an important part in the electric sports car.\nThe interior: sporty and spacious The strong focus of the interior on the driver – inspired by the “monoposto” concept, a typical design feature of the sporty Audi models – is a characteristic of the e-tron GT. The upper section of the three-dimensional instrument panel is drawn away from the driver in a large, elegant arc. This space is occupied by the display of the Audi virtual cockpit plus, which is shaded by its own cowl. The flat-bottomed steering wheel features multifunction buttons, and its rim can be heated as an option (standard with the RS model ).\nThe center console is tilted toward the driver, and the central MMI touch display is conveniently located in its upper section, where is it easy to see. It is surrounded by a black piano finish bezel that seems to float above the instrument panel and tapers into a wing to the right. When the ambient lighting package plus is on board, the bezel bears a lasered and backlit “e-tron” badge. The standard three-zone automatic air-conditioning is located above the central air vents, where it is easy to reach.\nThe entire instrument panel appears lean and light. It is divided into horizontal levels, creating width and spatial depth. This impression is emphasized effectively in the dark by the ambient lighting package plus with its 30 adjustable colors (standard in the RS model ). The central level spans the entire width of the interior. The lateral air vents underline this sense of width: Aluminum brackets surround their tips that plunge deep into recesses in the door trims. The flowing lines of the door rail visually merge in a straight line into the fender contours of the front section, inspired by the quattro blisters on the exterior.\nThe driver and passenger sit in a sporty low position, separated by the wide center tunnel. The selector switch for the gears, which provides a highly precise haptic control experience, is situated on its console. The rear seats also offer enough space for adults, as their backrests can be folded forward in the ratio 40:20:40. The uncompromisingly high quality and processing of the materials documents the attention to detail with which Audi develops and builds cars.\nSee video for more details.\n  Sustainable is the new premium: materials, fabrics, colors, and equipment The front seats are available in three designs. Available as standard in the e-tron GT quattro are the sport seats with electric eight-way adjustment and artificial leather/pearl Nappa leather covers. The RS e-tron GT is equipped with sport seats plus with 14-way adjustment, lumbar support and seat heating.\nThe sport seats pro with 18-way adjustment, pneumatic side bolsters, climate control, and (upon request) a massage function are available as an option for both models. In both seat variants, a bezel in the area of the head restraint further sharpens the sporty contour. The seats and steering wheel of the RS model feature special badges, and the pedal caps and footrest are made of stainless steel.\nFor fans with exquisite taste: the design packages The black leather-free design package is available for the sport seats plus. Upholstery is available either as a combination of artificial leather and the Kaskade material or as a mixture of artificial leather and the microfiber material Dinamica. In both cases, the covers consist predominantly of materials such as polyester fibers that were made from recycled PET bottles, textiles, or residual fibers. Each set of Kaskade covers is made of 119 recycled plastic bottles. Dinamica is a breathable microfiber material made proportionally from recycled polyester fibers and recycled PET. Kaskade is reminiscent of natural fibers such as wool and offers a very pleasant seating feel. The stitching of the seat center panels of both covers is based on the look of the Singleframe.\nThe sport seats pro are made of a combination of two types of leather: fine Nappa leather for the side bolsters and pearl Nappa leather with a perforated honeycomb pattern for the center panels. They are available in black, Santos brown, Arras red, or Monaco gray. The seat colors harmonize with the color-matched interior. In the red and gray RS design packages, red or gray contrasting stitching contrasts with black covers; the seat belts also come in red or gray.\nAudi offers a broad range of upholstery materials, from artificial leather and Dinamica and all the way to full leather, for the upper section of the instrument panel, the steering wheel rim, the door trims, the armrests, and the center console. The floor carpet and floor mats in both models are generally made of Econyl, a material that consists of 100-percent recycled nylon fibers. These fibers are gained from production waste, fabric and carpet remnants, or old fishing nets.\nThe large application area on the instrument panel is painted in a fine paint finish, graphite gray or palladium silver (in the RS model ). Open-pore walnut wood decor or silk-matt carbon with twill are available as alternatives. With the ambient lighting package plus, the “e-tron GT” logo is projected onto the ground when the driver’s door is opened. While aluminum inserts for the door sill trims are standard, the range extends all the way to carbon material with illumination.\nThe Audi exclusive program from Audi Sport GmbH fulfills many personal customer requests for equipment, in particular with regard to leather, the stitching, and the seat belts, which are available with colored edges. The cognac/jet gray design package is available as an upscale all-in-one solution. The seats are upholstered with brown fine Nappa leather here, and gray contrasting stitching throughout the interior adds highlights from the steering wheel rim to the floor mats.\nBelow you find all details about the interior options.\n Audi e-tron GT seats and interior materials Audi e-tron GT have serveral seats options to choose from\n  Audi e-tron GT steering wheels Audi e-tron GT have serveral steering wheel options\n  Headliner design You can order the e-tron GT with two different interior headliner colors\n  Inlays You can choose between different inlays\n  Interior \u0026amp; ambient lights Audi e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\n  Interior materials You can select specific interior materials to give Audi e-tron GT a more exclusive look\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/","title":"Audi e-tron interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has a luxury interior with many options on seats, interior design, interior lights, and many more so that you can personalize the car as you like it.","content":"Below you find the different options.\n Audi e-tron seats and interior materials Audi e-tron have serveral seats options to choose from\n  Audi e-tron steering wheels Audi e-tron have serveral steering wheel options\n  Button styles You can order the e-tron with different button styles\n  Headliner design You can order the e-tron with two different interior headliner colors\n  Inlays You can choose between different inlays\n  Interior \u0026amp; ambient lights Audi e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\n  S-Line interior S-Line interior gives a sporty look inside from unique S-line options.\n  Audi e-tron rear door curtains You can order the e-tron with curtains on the rear door\n  Interior materials You can add interior leather to the car to give it a more exclusive look\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/interior/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron has a luxury interior with different options in seats and design.","content":"In addition you can select different types of lightning, steeringwheels, interior design.\n Audi Q4 e-tron seats and interior materials Audi Q4 e-tron have serveral seats options to choose from\n  Audi Q4 e-tron steering wheels Audi Q4 e-tron have serveral steering wheel options\n  Interior \u0026amp; Ambient lights Audi Q4 e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\n  Audi Q4 e-tron Interior Storage Audi Q4 e-tron has lots of storage options inside\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/exterior/mirrors/","title":"Audi e-tron mirrors","tags":[],"description":"The mirrors can be delivered in 3 different styles and with different functionality.","content":"Functionality Electric adjustable mirrors are standard on Audi e-tron (option ID 6XD).

They are being launched on the European markets with two different battery sizes and three motor line-ups. In the Q4 35 e-tron and Q4 40 e-tron a permanently excited synchronous machine (PSM) on the rear wheels provides the drive – these two models, along with the R8 V10 RWD high-performance sports car, are the only series-production Audi models with purely rear-wheel drive. The Q4 45 e-tron and the Q4 50 e-tron quattro as the sporty top model uses two electric motors for its electric all-wheel drive.\nEntry-level model: the Q4 35 e-tron The entry-level models Audi Q4 35 e-tron are equipped with the compact battery that has a net energy content of 52 kWh (55 kWh gross). An electric motor with an output of 125 kW (170 PS) and torque of 310 Nm provides the drive. In both body variants, it accelerates the electric SUV from 0 to 100 km/h in 9.0 seconds and produces a governed top speed of 160 km/h. The Q4 35 e-tron can cover up to 341 kilometers (211.9 mi) (WLTP cycle) on a single battery charge, while the Q4 Sportback 35 e-tron does up to 349 kilometers (216.9 mi) (WLTP).\nRange of up to 520 kilometers (323.1 mi): the Q4 40 e-tron The Audi Q4 40 e-tron features the large battery, which stores a net 76.6 kWh of energy (82 kWh gross). The electric motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm in this configuration. It is the same motor (APP310) used.\nEntry model with two electric motors: the Q4 45 e-tron quattro The Q4 45 e-tron quattro run on the 76.6 kWh battery (82 kWh gross). It supplies two electric motors that combine to produce a maximum output of 195 kW (265 PS) and 460 Nm (339.3 lb-ft) of torque, while making electric all-wheel drive become a reality.\nTop model with two electric motors: the Q4 50 e-tron quattro The top models Q4 50 e-tron quattro and Q4 Sportback 50 e-tron quattro also run on the 77 kWh battery (82 kWh gross). It supplies two electric motors that combine to produce a maximum output of 220 kW (299 PS)(Maximum output determined according to UN-GTR.21.) and 460 Nm (339.3 lb-ft) of torque, while making electric all-wheel drive become a reality. The rear motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm, the front motor 80 kW (109 PS) and 162 Nm. The electric motors keep reserves available for certain driving situations, which is why the sum of their individual outputs exceeds the drive’s total output.\nThe full power is only available above 80% SOC. After that it will drop down against 265HP. This screenshot show how the boost level is about 50% at 66% SOC.\nMotor technology While there are three motor configurations there are only two types of electric motors used on Q4 e-tron\nAPP310 - Rear electric motor It is the same rear electric motor on all versions of Q4, but it perform different on Q35 vs Q40/Q45/Q50 because of different battery pack. The rear electric motor has the following specifictions.\n axial parallel achitecture PSM motor with hairpin winding 150 kW / 310 Nm liquid cooled max. rotor speed: 16.000 rpm single speed gearbox two-stage speed reduction (13:1 RWD / 11.5:1 AWD) weight: ~90 kg  Below you see Sandy Munro go through the rear motor\n  Front electric motor Only Q5 45 Quattro and 50 Quattro has the front motor. The front electric motor has the following specifictions.\n coaxial architecture ASM motor with distributed pull-in winding Aluminum rotor 80 kW / 162 Nm liquid cooled max. rotor speed: 14.000 rpm single speed gearbox two-stage speed reduction (~10:1) weight: ~60 kg  The principal advantages of the ASM are its short-term overload capacity and the minimal drag losses while idling. For efficiency reasons the front e-axle comes into action only when high power or a strong grip is needed.\nGearbox The powerful APP310 e-drive unit transmits power to the driven wheels using an extremely compact gearbox. The Q4 single gear is able to cope with all driving situations. The mechanism used has only a small number of cogs. This 1-speed gearbox is part of the electric drive system for the modular electric drive matrix (MEB) and is manufactured by Volkswagen Group Components at the Kassel plant.\nThermal management The motors are liquid cooled. Each motor has liquid stator cooling to give maximum thermal robustness under all operating conditions\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q6-e-tron/drivetrain/motor/","title":"Audi Q6 e-tron motors","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q6 e-tron will have different motor configurations.","content":"TODO when we know :-)\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/exterior/panoramicroof/","title":"Audi e-tron panoramic roof","tags":[],"description":"If you want to stand out in the crowd you can order your e-tron with panoramic roof.","content":"The roof can be openeded.

Each module is fitted with its own computer that monitors the temperature and voltage. The unusually high system voltage of approx. 800 volts enables a powerful continuous output and shortens the charging duration; in addition, it reduces the weight of, and space required by, the wiring.\nThe battery system is located beneath the passenger compartment, at the lowest point of the car. This, in combination with the electric motors, provides a low center of gravity appropriate for a sports car and a weight distribution between the front and rear axles that is very close to the ideal value of 50:50.\nThirty modules form the lower level of the battery that features a wide recess in the rear section. It creates space for the rear passengers’ feet, which allows them to sit in a low position and also enables the flat vehicle silhouette. The upper “floor” contains three further modules situated below the rear seats. The connections, fuses, and the main control unit are located under the console of the center tunnel. The bottom of the battery is protected by an aluminium plate.\nCell technology The cell used is LG Chem E66A. The cell type is LG Pouch Cell produced in Poland.\n   Spec Value     Nominal Capacity 64.6 Ah   Minimum Capacity 63,5 Ah   Nominal Voltage 3,651515 V   Nominal energy 235,888 Wh   Minimum energy 232,2 Wh   Thickness 11,7 mm   Width 104 mm   Height 350 mm   Volume 0,425880   Weight 897 g   Volumetric Energy Density 648 Wh/L   Gravimetric Energy Density 263 Wh/kg   Chemistry NCM 712    Battery pack capacity The confiugration of the battery cells are 198s2p, meaning there is two and two cells in paralell with 198 pairs in serial.\nAudi/Porsche rates the capacity to each cell to 64.6Ah or 129.2Ah per cell pair.\nThe nominal voltage is 198 * 3.65151515 = 723 Volt.\n723 volt * 129.2Ah gives = 93400Wh or 93.4kWh as stated.\nFully charged it cell 4.217 Volt in total 835Voltage. Empty each cell has 3.08 volt giving in a pack voltage on 610 Volt.\nTotal battery weight is 630 kg (1389 pound).\nEach module weighs aprox 13kg.\nMax charging speed is 270kW.\nBattery housing The waterproof housing is a sandwich construction consisting of a cover at the top and a bulkhead plate at the bottom. The truss-design battery frame with multiple subdivisions is mounted in between. The cooling elements are glued on underneath the bulkhead plate.\nThe battery housing is secured by means of a steel protective plate. For the battery frame, the developers opted for a lightweight aluminium design. On the one hand, this provides a lot of installation space for the cell modules - and consequently a high battery capacity. On the other hand, this has made it possible for the vehicle weight to be kept low. Modern joining techniques are used such as MIG welding (metal welding with inert gases) on the battery frame, laser welding on the bulkhead and protection plates and heat-conducting adhesive on the line system under the battery (see below).\nThermal managment Beneath the cell space of the battery, there is a compound structure of flat extruded sections through which a glycol/water mixture flows that circulates in its own low-temperature circuit. The temperature is transferred between the cooling plates and the cell space via a heat-conducting paste. The battery’s feel-good temperature is between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius, and its operating range extends from minus 30 to plus 50 degrees.\nFour separate coolant circuits, each at its own temperature level, regulate the temperature in the high-voltage components and the interior precisely and quickly. They can be interconnected flexibly as required. If the driver demands a high output several times in a row, valves couple the coolant circuit of the battery with the refrigerant circuit of the air-conditioning system – this intensive cooling keeps the performance of the drive at a consistently high level. The e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT can accelerate to full speed from a standstill up to ten consecutive times.\nThe refrigerant circuit also helps with cooling during fast DC charging, which can heat the battery up to 50 degrees Celsius. The thermal management is connected to the navigation system. When the driver sets an HPC terminal (High Power Charging) as the destination, the cooling of the battery is already intensified on the way to the charging station so that it can be charged as quickly as possible. Should the battery still be very cold shortly after the car is started in winter, it is heated for fast charging.\nThe standard equipment of the e-tron GT includes a heat pump that heats the interior with the waste heat of the high-voltage components. It can reduce the loss of range that the electric climate control causes in winter in particular significantly. In addition to charging, customers can also manage pre-entry climate control of the interior via their smartphones using the myAudi app. This is done via a powerful high-voltage heating element and does not depend on the car charging via the power grid. Audi equips the e-tron GT with a deluxe auxiliary air-conditioning system as an option that also incorporates the steering wheel rim (if heatable), the exterior mirrors and the rear window.\n  Charging The charging flaps of the gran turismo are located behind the front wheels. Both sides feature connections for alternating current (AC) and there is also a connection for direct current (DC) on the right-hand side. The Audi e-tron GT is delivered to its customers with two charging cables as standard: one mode 3 cable for public AC terminals and the charging system compact for the garage. The e-tron GT can charge with 11 kW AC as standard, which allows it to recharge an empty battery overnight. An optional onboard charger for 22 kW is available.\nAt a direct current terminal with a voltage of 800 V, for example in the European freeway network from Ionity, the Audi e-tron GT achieves a peak charging capacity of up to 270 kW. This allows it to recharge energy for up to 100 kilometers (62.1 mi) in just over five minutes, and charging from five to 80 percent SoC (state of charge) takes less than 22.5 minutes under ideal conditions. The driver can restrict the charging target in the MMI operating system, for example if the rate appears too high.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/drivetrain/battery/","title":"Audi e-tron battery","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron is delivered with two different battery sizes. 95kWh and 71kWh.","content":"Cell technology Audi/Volkswagen has a multi-vendor strategy on cells.

It is expected that from the 2023-model there will be added a larger pack.\n95kWh battery The battery for the Audi e-tron 55/e-tron 60S is totally on 95kWh and with a nominal voltage of 396 volts.\nIt consists of 36 modules with 12 cells each that give a total of 432.\nThe cells in each module are connected in 4p3s configuration. Meaning 4 and 4 cells are grouped in parallel and then connected in serial.\nSince each cell is on 60ah each parallel group gives a capacity of 240Ah. (4 x 60ah)\nWhen 36 modules like this are connected in serial the nominal voltage is 396 volt.\n396volt * 240ah = 95 040 Watt-hour (Wh) or 95kWh (kilo Watt Hours)\nEach module is on 11 Volt and has a capacity of 240 x 11 = 2640 Wh or 2.64 kWh.\nEach module weighs approx 13kg.\nTotal battery weight is 1532.2lb (699,99 kg)\nFor models produced before week 47 in 2019, the available battery is 83.6 kWh. This has part number 1 AX2. For models produced after that, the buffer has been decreased so the available capacity is 86.5 kWh increasing the range by 3,4%.\n71kWh battery The battery for the Audi e-tron 50 is totally on 71kWh and was created to support a cheaper e-tron.\nIt has a total of 27 modules with 12 cells each that give a total of 324 cells. It is no coincidence that it has 27 modules.\nOne important factor was that it has to have the same nominal voltage at 396 volts.\nThis was possible by changing the battery architecture from 4 cells in parallel to 3 cells in parallel.\nSince each cell is on 60ah each parallel group gives a capacity of 180Ah. (3 x 60ah)\nWhen 27 modules like this are connected in serial the nominal voltage is 396 volt.\n396volt * 180ah = 71 280 Watt-hour (Wh) or 71kWh (kilo Watt Hours)\nEach module is on 14.666 Volt and has a capacity of 14.666 x 14.666 = 2640 Wh or 2.64 kWh.\nBattery housing The 71kWh battery consist of 27 modules and all are located on the same \u0026ldquo;floor\u0026rdquo;.\nMost of the battery housing parts are reused with the larger 95kWh battery. The 95kWh uses a second floor under the rear seats to get the room needed for the 36 modules.\nThe diagram below shows how the e-tron 50 / e-tron Sportback 50 has fewer modules.\nSophisticated measures have been taken to protect the high-voltage battery of the Audi e\u0002tron. A strong enclosing frame of cast aluminum nodes and extruded sections, plus an aluminum plate 3.5 millimeters (0.1 in) thick protect against damage from accidents or curbs. Inside, a framework-like aluminum structure reinforces the battery system. Also comprised of extruded sections, it holds the cell modules like a typecase.\nIncluding the housing with its sophisticated crash structures comprising 47 percent extruded aluminum sections, 36 percent aluminum sheet, and 17 percent diecast aluminum parts, the battery system weighs around 700 kilograms (1,543.2 lb). It is bolted to the body structure of the Audi e-tron at 35 points. This increases its torsional rigidity by 27 percent and contributes to the high level of the safety of the Audi e-tron, as does the cooling system bonded to the outside of the battery housing. Compared to a conventional SUV, the Audi e-tron offers 45 percent higher torsional rigidity, a key parameter for precise handling and acoustic comfort\nThermal management The battery packs are created to give high performance over a large range of temperature and charge levels.\nA cooling system of flat aluminum extruded sections divided uniformly into small chambers has the task of maintaining the battery’s high-performance operation over the long term.\nHeat is exchanged between the cells and the cooling system beneath them via a thermally conductive gel pressed beneath each cell module. In what is a particularly efficient solution, the gel evenly transfers the waste heat to the coolant via the battery housing.\nThe battery and all of its parameters, such as charge status, power output, and thermal management, are managed by the external battery management controller (BMC). This is located in the occupant cell on the right A-pillar of the Audi e-tron. The BMC communicates both with the control units of the electric motors and the cell module controllers (CMC), each of which monitors the current, voltage, and temperature of the modules.\nThe battery junction box (BJB), into which the high-voltage relays and fuses are integrated, is the electrical interface to the vehicle. Enclosed in a die-cast aluminum housing, it is located in the front section of the battery system. Data exchange between the BMC, the CMCs, and the BJB is via a separate bus system.\nCharging performance Audi e-tron 55/S and Audi e-tron 50 is one of the fastest charging EVs on the market.\nFor the 71kWh battery, the max charge speed is 125kW\nFor the 95kWh battery, the max charging speed is 150kW.\nDiagramm from FASTNED\nThere are several cars with higher top speed on charging, but the consistently high performance from low SOC to high SOC makes it overall faster than most other cars.\nCharging curve\nSee video comparison below.\n  In cold weather, the charging speed typical will get lower in the beginning until the temprature comes up.

Put into motion by an electric spindle drive, the displacement piston pushes the brake fluid into the brake lines. The transition from the engine brake to the pure friction brake is smooth, and the driver does not notice it.\nA second piston generates the familiar pedal feeling for the driver’s foot by means of a pressure-resistant element. Thanks to this brake pedal simulator, the driver is not affected by what is happening in the hydraulics. In the case of ABS braking, pressure buildup and reduction are not noticeable in the form of irritating hard pulsations.\nThe electrohydraulic brake system is activated when the driver depresses the left-hand pedal so hard that the deceleration exceeds 0.3 g; otherwise, the Audi e-tron decelerates through recuperation via the two electric motors. The brake control system build up brake pressure for the wheel brakes with great precision and roughly twice as fast as a conventional system.\nWhen automated emergency braking is performed, there are only 150 milliseconds between the initiation of the brake application and the presence of maximum brake pressure between the pads and disks. This is barely more than a blink of the eye and creates impressively short braking distances. Even at a very slow speed, such as during maneuvering, the car decelerates via the wheel brakes because this is more efficient than electric braking in this case. Otherwise, the electric motor would have to use valuable battery current to decelerate actively at low rotational speeds.\nThe “brake-by-wire” technology of the electrohydraulically integrated brake control system enables a larger air gap, i.e. a greater distance between the brake pad and brake disk, to be set. This minimizes possible friction and heat generation and contributes actively to the vehicle’s long range.\nRecuperation The recuperation technology in e-tron can significantly increase range, depending on topografy on roads.\nOn e-tron 55 and 50 the recuperation can reach 220kW depending on speed. On e-tron S it can reach 275kW.

The e-tron GT quattro accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 4.1 seconds; the RS model achieves this in just 3.3 seconds.","content":"Both values apply for boost with launch control, which the driver can access in “dynamic” mode of the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. The RS model reaches the 200 km/h (124.3 mph) mark in 10.9 seconds, and has a top speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph). The e-tron GT quattro has a top speed of 245 km/h (152.2 mph).\nIn the e-tron GT quattro, the front electric motor outputs 175 kW (238 PS), and the rear motor outputs 320 kW (435 PS). Both electric motors keep reserves available for extreme driving situations, which is why the sum of their individual outputs exceeds the drive’s total output of 350 kW (476 PS) considerably. Up to 390 kW (530 PS) are available for roughly 2.5 seconds in boost mode via launch control. The total torque is 630 Nm (464.7 lb-ft). In the RS e-tron GT, the electric motor at the front axle also outputs 175 kW (238 PS), while the motor in the rear outputs 335 kW (456 PS). The total output is 440 kW (598 PS), and the total torque is 830 Nm (612.2 lb-ft). In boost mode, the output briefly increases to 475 kW (646 PS).\nMore copper in the stator: the hairpin winding The PSM motors (permanently excited synchronous motors) in the e-tron GT are extremely efficient, with an efficiency of considerably more than 90 percent in the majority of all driving situations. They are produced with a complex technology known as hairpin winding. The coils of the stator consist of rectangular copper wires that look similar to hairpins after they have been bent. This allows the wires to be packed more tightly, as a result of which considerably more copper fits into the stator as compared to the conventional round winding. This increases the output and torque and makes the cooling of the electric motors, which takes place via a separate medium-temperature circuit, more efficient.\nThe electric motor, the power electronics, and the transmission form a compact block on both axles. The front motor is installed coaxially and has a ratio of 8.1:1. The rear electric motor is installed parallel to the axles and sends its torque to a two-speed transmission with three shafts. The second gear (ratio of 8.2:1) provides excellent efficiency and also large amounts of reserve power. The first gear, which has a very short ratio of 15.6:1, ensures spirited acceleration right from the start, if the driver so desires. If the driver decides against this, the car moves off in first gear. The driver generally does not need to press a start button to drive off and can just depress the brake pedal and engage the “D” or “R” gear. As soon as they take their foot off the brake pedal, the car starts to roll at low speed.\nThe new generation of quattro: the electric all-wheel drive The electric all-wheel drive in the e-tron GT quattroand RS e-tron GT regulates the drive torque distribution between the axles – continuously, fully variably, and within a few thousandths of a second. The electric gran turismo thus offers powerful dynamism and optimum traction in any weather conditions. The quattro principle of the four-wheel drive that Audi introduced to the market more than 40 years ago presents itself on a new, fascinating technological level.\nWhen the e-tron GT is being driven in the “comfort” mode of Audi drive select, both electric motors work together in the most energy-conserving way possible. In “dynamic” mode, its character is more rear-heavy, while “efficiency” mode clearly prioritizes front-wheel drive. With a slippery road surface, high power requirements, or fast cornering, more torque can be distributed to the rear wheels – and around five times faster than with a mechanical quattro drivetrain.\nEfficiency takes priority: coasting or recuperation When the driver releases the right-hand pedal, the drive of the e-tron GT generally switches to coasting. This strategy prevents the losses associated with every conversion of energy. The large gran turismo glides calmly and efficiently while its electric motors run along virtually deenergized. Coasting recuperation takes place at the front electric motor and only in the “dynamic” mode of Audi drive select.\nRegardless of the driving mode, the driver can use the rocker switches on the steering wheel to adjust two manual recuperation levels of different strengths. They can select an automatic level in the MMI system, where the rocker switches are non-functional. In this case, the predictive efficiency assist regulates coasting and recuperation on the basis of data which is obtains from the navigation system and the onboard sensors. For example, when the car is approaching a roundabout or a slower car driving in front, the drive management system attempts to reduce the speed by coasting. If the available distance is too short, it switches to recuperation. In this case, maximum deceleration is slightly higher than in the manual recuperation levels, reaching up to 0.13 g.\nBrake recuperation: output of up to 265 kW While braking, the electric motors perform decelerations alone up to around 0.3 g, i.e. the vast majority of all brake applications in everyday driving. The hydraulic wheel brakes are activated only when the driver brakes very heavily. The transition is almost unnoticeable, and recuperation remains active almost up to a standstill. If both electric motors are involved in brake recuperation in order to ensure handling stability, they can recover up to 265 kW of power. In all driving situations – be it full acceleration, dynamic handling, coasting or brake recuperation – the gran turismo remains unshakably stable because its control systems for brakes, suspension, drive, and power electronics are closely connected and work together quickly.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/drivetrain/motor/","title":"Audi e-tron electric motors &amp; setup","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has powerful electric motors and was the first EV to have a tri-motor configuration.

If both electric motors are involved in brake recuperation in order to ensure handling stability, they can recover up to 275 kW of power. In all driving situations – be it full acceleration, dynamic handling, coasting or brake recuperation – the Audi e-tron remains unshakably stable because its control systems for brakes, suspension, drive, and power electronics are closely connected and work together quickly.\nDifferential and electric torque vectoring In addition to electric all-wheel drive, Audi e-tron S are equipped with electric torque vectoring:\nFor reasons relating to efficiency, the rear electric motors in the Audi e-tron S and e-tron S Sportback provide propulsion when driving normally. The front electric motor is deenergized, but flashes into action when the driver demands more output, or predictively before slip occurs when driving on slippery roads or cornering at high speed. This electric all-wheel drive is now being enhanced with electric torque vectoring at the rear axle: Each of the two electric motors send their torques directly to the wheel via a transmission; there is no longer a mechanical differential.\nThanks to the spontaneity of the electric motors, electric torque vectoring, that is the distribution of the torque between the rear wheels, takes place within milliseconds. The time offset as compared to a mechanical system is shorter by a factor of four. It can also manage considerably higher torque: When the driver accelerates out of a corner at a sporty speed, the outside rear wheel is subject to 220 Nm (162.3 lb-ft) more than the inside wheel. Due to the gear ratio, the difference at the wheels is around 2,100 Nm (1,548.9 lb-ft). The yaw moment that is generated supports the steering characteristics and the curve radius can be retained with a smaller steering angle. Electric torque vectoring also offers great strengths in terms of pure traction: If one of the rear wheels is on very slippery ground during acceleration, e.g. a patch of ice or gravel, it receives no torque. Almost all of the torque is transferred to the wheel that has stronger traction.\nA prerequisite for the high speed and precision with which the electric all-wheel drive and the electric torque vectoring work is the close linking of the following control units: the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC), the drive control unit (ASG), the electronic chassis platform (ECP), and the control units of the performance electronics, which output voltage pulses up to 10,000 times per second. All software functions, apart from the ESC, are Audi in-house developments that benefit from the brand’s roughly 40 years of quattro experience.\nThe ECP is the mastermind among the control units: It makes the crucial contribution to the management of the all-wheel drive and electric torque vectoring. It calculates the ideal distribution of longitudinal and transverse torque on the basis of the data from the sensors that continuously inform it on the car’s driving condition and the driver’s request. One of its tasks is wheel-selective torque control: At the dynamic limit, the unloaded front wheel on the inside of the curve is braked slightly via the wheel brake. This minor, almost unnoticeable intervention prevents slip and makes handling even more agile and neutral.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/soundsystem/","title":"Audi e-tron soundsystem","tags":[],"description":"You can choose between two different sound systems on Audi e-tron","content":"Audi sound system The standard sound system is a 150 Watt 6 channel system with 10 speakers including center speaker and subwoofer.\nOptionId 9VD\nBang \u0026amp; Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound The Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound offers a fascinating feature for hi-fi fans – sound that includes the spatial dimension of height.

The type of damping control provided varies between the two running gear versions, adaptive air suspension and adaptive air suspension sport that is standard on e-tron S and S-Line e-tron.\nThe adaptive air suspension – an air suspension system with controlled damping – offers a wide range between smooth cruising and sporty handling. Depending on the speed and the driver’s preferences, it individually adjusts the ride height according to the road conditions. The air suspension also offers level control as a function of load.\nThe central chassis control unit, the electronic chassis platform (ECP), individually controls the function of the shock absorbers on each wheel at cycles in the order of milliseconds – according to the road surface condition, driving style and the mode the driver sets in the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. Solenoid damper valves vary the volumetric flow of the hydraulic fluid.\nAdaptive Air Suspension has optionId 1BK and adaptive air suspension sport has option ID 2MB\nRegulating characteristics The regulating characteristics (regulation of ride heights depending on vehicle speed and mode) are identical on both versions. On other Audis like Q7 and Q8 the Adaptive Sport Suspension is 1cm lower. But this is not the case on Audi e-tron.\nThe diagram below show how this is adjusted depending on speed.\nThe illustration shows the control strategy for the air suspension systems. By selecting the preferred driving mode in Audi drive select, the driver determines the vehicle’s ride height and dynamic characteristics. At the same time, different ride heights are also automatically set within the selected driving mode, depending on the current vehicle speed. An example of this can be seen in the control strategy when “auto” mode is selected: If the vehicle is currently set to a different ride height, the normal level is set by changing the volume of air in the air springs if the mode is selected when the vehicle is stationary or travelling at a speed below 120 km/h.\nIf the vehicle subsequently exceeds a speed of 120 km/h, the ride height will immediately be lowered by 13 mm to low level 1. If the speed then increases further to at least 140 km/h and remains there for 20 seconds, the ride height will be lowered again by a further 13 mm to motorway level. If the speed is subsequently reduced again and the vehicle is driven at a speed of 110 km/h or lower for a duration of 30 seconds, the ride height is raised by 13 mm to the ride height previously set. If the speed is reduced further to 5 km/h, the vehicle is immediately raised to the original level (normal level).\nLowering the car Even you can adjust the ride height, some want it even lower. Here are some examples on cars lowered with lowering links or software adjustment.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/drivetrain/suspension/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron suspension","tags":[],"description":"The Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron integrate the best conditions for high levels of comfort, driving pleasure, and unshakable stability","content":" The front axle of the compact electric SUVs is designed in the classic McPherson construction method, the steering is located underneath at the front.

The gran turismo philosophy becomes a perfect experience here, too.\nThe wheel suspensions are designed as a sporty double wishbone construction. It has a classic design on the front axle, while the upper wishbones in the rear are divided into individual links. Almost all parts, including the links and subframes, are forged or cast from aluminum. The electromechanical steering has a sporty and direct ratio of 15.4:1 but without any excessive sharpness.\nAs part of the optional dynamic package with id PA2 on Audi e-tron GT and included as standard on RS e-tron GT, Audi supplies all-wheel steering. A spindle drive turns the rear wheels by a maximum of 2.8 degrees here– in opposite directions up to about 50 km/h (31.1 mph) to increase agility and handling, and in the same direction from about 80 km/h (49.7 mph) to maintain stability. Between 50 (31.1 mph) and 80 km/h (49.7 mph), depending on the driving situation, there is a continuous transition between a steering angle in opposite directions and a steering angle in the same direction. When maneuvering, the all-wheel steering reduces the turning circle by roughly 0.6 meters (2.0 ft).\nPrecision-controlled: air suspension and damping While the adaptive air suspension is optional in the Audi e-tron GT quattro, it comes as standard in the RS model. Its compressor generates a working pressure of up to 19 bar, and the three-chamber air suspension on the front and rear axles enables comfortable basic suspension. The chambers in the bellows are activated and deactivated depending on the driving situation. During smooth driving, all three of them contribute to the suspension, while only one or two chambers are active in the case of dynamic requirements such as heavy braking or high transverse acceleration – this strategy reduces the movement of the body.\nThe air suspension can adjust the body to different heights. It lowers the body by up to 10 millimeters (0.4 in) at a speed of 90 km/h (55.9 mph), and by another 12 millimeters (0.5 in) at 180 km/h (111.8 mph). When driving at a speed below 30 km/h (18.6 mph), the driver can set a lift mode that raises the body by 20 millimeters (0.8 in), for example when driving into underground parking garages. The adaptive air suspension works closely together with the controlled dampers (standard) that adjust to the circumstances at millisecond intervals. Both systems are managed by a central control unit, the electronic chassis platform (ECP). This connection ensures maximum precision.\nFour driving modes: Audi drive select In the Audi drive select dynamic handling system (standard), the driver can specify how the dampers, electric motors, two-speed transmission, and controlled rear-axle differential lock are to operate. They can switch between the “comfort,” “efficiency,” “dynamic,” and “individual” modes via a physical switch. In “efficiency” mode, the body is lowered to the low level to promote better airflow and the top speed is limited to 140 km/h (87.0 mph); however, the driver can override this limit by stepping heavily on the accelerator pedal. In “dynamic” mode, the electric all-wheel drive, the suspension systems, and the active aerodynamics are set to a sporty mode.\nFor dynamic handling: rear-axle differential lock The controlled rear-axle differential lock, which is integrated in the ECP control operations, is available as standard with the RS e-tron GT and as part of the dynamic package option with the e-tron GT. The multi-plate clutch is its core element. It can be actuated fully variably, and the locking range extends from zero to 100 percent. The driver can perceive this on slippery road surfaces and during maximum full-stop braking in particular: In this case, the lock opens up completely, allowing the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC) to brake each wheel with great precision. It improves traction and stability, increasing lateral acceleration and reducing load change behaviour through targeted torque vectoring. The rear wheel on the inside of the bend is braked in a targeted manner as the car enters a sharp corner – resulting in the car turning slightly into the bend.\nAnimation: Audi RS e-tron GT – three-chamber air suspension and all-wheel steering This animation shows the function of the Three-chamber air suspension and the all-wheel steering in the chassis of the Audi RS e-tron GT.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/","title":"Audi e-tron GT technology","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT has a lot of advanced technology.

Support for Wirless Android Auto Shortcut to charging screen in MMI added to lower MMI screen  MY 2023 (from summer 2022) This is the first real facelift version of e-tron. It is expected to have a larger battery. What kind of size is currently not confirmed but one theory is that they will replace the 432 60AH cells in a 108s4p configuration with a 108s3p configuration with Samsung 94AH cells. In total 324 cells on the e-tron 55.\nThis will keep the nominal voltage at 397 volts but increase gross capacity from 95kWh to 112kWh. If 108kWh is made available this would increase range to 461 - 565km depending on equipment trim this from the current range on 369-452km depending on equipment trim.\nFor the e-tron 50 they could in theory offer a version with 108s2p with only 74kWh gross battery. But this is not likely.\nIn addition, you could expect some other technical improvements that slightly would reduce consumption. The current minimum WLTP consumption is 19.1 kWh/100km. If they are able to reduce this to 18.5 you could see rated range up to 580km.\nBut all is unconfirmed.
