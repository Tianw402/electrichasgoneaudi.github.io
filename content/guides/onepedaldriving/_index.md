linktitle: One-Pedal driving
description: One-pedal driving allows a driver to bring a vehicle to a full stop without using the brake pedal. This is also possible on all-electric Audis.

On EVs, this is typically implemented so that when the driver lifts the foot of the throttle pedal, the electric motors will start regenerating and thereby reduce the speed of the car by up to 0.3G. In this way, you never need to use the brake pedal (you can if it is an emergency). That is the reason they call it "one-pedal-driving"

Using regeneration instead of physical brakes can significantly reduce consumption since regeneration puts energy back into the battery instead of creating heat in the physical brakes.

For many EVs, this is the only way to regenerate energy and thereby the recommended way to drive that specific EV. But for all-electric Audis, there are more efficient ways to drive.

All-electric Audis have advanced blended brakes that can mix regeneration and physical brakes using the brake pedal, meaning if you use the brake pedal, you will only regenerate and put energy back in the battery as long as your reduce speed with less than 0.3G. This is possible with brake-by-wire technology developed by Audi that controlls the use of brakes and regeneration in motors.

Using the brake pedal for braking this way is in most cases slightly more efficient than one-pedal driving. That's why Audi wants their drivers to maximize the efficiency with coasting instead of automatic reducing speed when you lift the foot of the gas pedal.

This is because you only get approx 80% of the kinetic energy the moving car has, back to the battery, when doing recuperation. (Assuming the traffic and road allow to coast), and using one-pedal driving will for most drivers mean you will end up doing more recuperation compared to using the brake pedal or letting the car regenerate automatically only when needed.

Using one-pedal driving is also less comfortable since you are forced to have the foot on the pedal at a specific position to freeroll/coast to find the position when no energy is going out of the battery and nothing is going in.

Audi has made it possible to enable one pedal driving on their all-electric models It is a little different on the different models but the principle Audi follows are the same.

## Audi e-tron

On Audi e-tron can set recuperation to manual (MMI -> Vehicle -> Efficiency Assistant -> Recuperation)  and then you can every time you start a drive, set recuperation to the max with the steering wheel recuperation paddles, and then it will regenerate every time you lift your foot of the "gas pedal" and works as "one-pedal-driving".

With the wheel paddles, you can set the recuperation to 3 different levels. (for more or less braking). High, medium and off.

This is not recommended for experienced drivers. If you learn to coast you will get the best comfort and the best range.
Next time it will be reset back. For drivers coming from other EV's, this might be the way to unlearn the bad habit.

If you set it recuperation to automatic it will only recuperate when you are getting close to other cars or you are close to an intersection or other reasons you need to slow down.  Otherwise, it will coast and save the maximum amount of energy as long you don't press the accelerator.

## Audi Q4 e-tron

On the Audi Q4 e-tron, there are two methods to enable one-pedal-driving

### Brake mode

On the Audi Q4 e-tron, you can set the car in B-mode (brake) with help of the shifter. In B-mode, the car will regenerate almost max when lifting the watt pedal.

### Dynamic in D mode with regen level set with paddles

The second way to enable one-pedal-driving is by setting the car in D-mode with the shifter and using the Dynamic mode in Drive Select.

This makes it possible to set regen to 0,1,2,3 with paddles and the car will remember it. Opposite to other drive select modes where the regen level is reset to 0 when using the throttle.

Driving in D-mode and using the brake pedals that automatically give regen gives the best efficiency. Coast whenever you can.

## Audi e-tron GT

On Audi e-tron GT this is the exact way as Audi e-tron.
