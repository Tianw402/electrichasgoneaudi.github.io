The range of electric cars are typical given as a [WLTP range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Harmonised_Light_Vehicles_Test_Procedure) (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure) in
Europe or [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles#EPA_testing_procedure:_2008_and_beyond) in US.

Below you see a the range of the different current and some future models. The range is from 341km (211 miles) to 700km (435 miles) according to the WLTP combined standard.

The most important aspect of range is of course how large the battery is. Larger battery means more energy to use.

The below chart show the available battery size for the different models.

But the battery is not the only factor in the stated range. Another important factor is how efficient the car is.

And with efficient it means how much energy is used from the battery for a given distance. In europe it is typical stated as kWh/100km meaning
how many kWh is needed to drive 100km. In US it is rated as miles per kWh, meaning how far can you go with 1 kWh.

The below diagram show the calculated consumption in kWh/100km for the different all-electric models are according to WLTP combined rating.
