The range of electric cars is typically given as a [WLTP range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Harmonised_Light_Vehicles_Test_Procedure) (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure) in
Europe or [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles#EPA_testing_procedure:_2008_and_beyond) in the US.

Below you see the range of the different current and some future models. The range is from 341km (211 miles) to 700km (435 miles) according to the WLTP combined standard.

The most important aspect of range is of course how large the battery is. A larger battery means more energy to use.

The below chart shows the available battery size for the different models.

But the battery is not the only factor in the stated range. Another important factor is how efficient the car is.

And with efficiency, it means how much energy is used from the battery for a given distance. In Europe, it is typical stated as kWh/100km meaning
how many kWh is needed to drive 100km. In the US and the UK, it is rated as miles per kWh, meaning how far can you go with 1 kWh.

The below diagram shows the calculated consumption in kWh/100km for the different all-electric models is according to WLTP combined rating.

## What affects the WLTP consumption?

The efficiency or WLTP consumption is affected by many attributes of the car.

### Aerodynamic drag

The aerodynamic drag affects how much energy is needed to move. The shape of the body affects it but also the design of the wheels.

Audi A6 e-tron concept is currently the model with the lowest [drag coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient) with a Cw value on only 0.22

### Rolling resistance

The [rolling resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance) sometimes called rolling friction or rolling drag is the force resisting the motion when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface.

This is affected by the width of the tires, the weight of the car, the tire compound, and the tire pressure.

Audi RS e-tron GT has very wide tires with 285mm to get the best traction. This increases rolling resistance. As an option, you can
get 305mm wide tires that increase traction and decreases range.

Some tire producers have started producing specific tires for EV with low rolling resistance.

### Weight

A heavier car requires more energy to move.

### The efficiency of the drivetrain/motors

Electric motors are very efficient by default, but there are still some different technologies that give different consumption based on the setup.

Permanently excited synchronous use less energy in use but have higher coasting resistance.
Induction motors use a little more energy to move but have almost zero coasting resistance.

Newer cars often combine these two techniques having a rear synchronous motor always in use and an induction motor in front. Example Audi Q4 e-tron quattro 50.

### The internal resistance of the battery

The internal resistance in the battery causes heat loss in the battery.

## Factors vary based on options

Many of the above factors are fixed. Like the e-tron Sportback has less drag than the e-tron SUV because of the body shape.

But other factors are affected by the equipment you add to your car. If you buy wider tires, you will get a higher consumption and then a shorter range.

The below diagram shows the maximum consumption based on selecting factory options for the car.

![Consumption](wltpconsumptiontoptrim.png "WLTP Consumption top trim")

From the diagram, you can see that an Audi e-tron 55 has a consumption of 19.61 kWh/100km in the basic trim, but 23.44 kWh/100km in the top trim.
Reducing the range from 441km to 369km.

## What affects the real world consumption

### The driving style

### The weather

### The temprature
