## How does it work?

The regeneration happens when the electric motors are used as generators to reduce the speed of a moving vehicle.

For quattro models, like the Audi e-tron, both engines can be used for regenerative braking depending on scenario.

For coasting and light braking only the rear motor is used, but when cornering or hard braking both motors are used. 

The brakes also blends in the physical brakes if needed.

The below video shows in detail how the different engines are used.

## What kind of energy can be regenerated?

### Kinetic energy

A moving object has kinetic energy. This energy depends on the weight of the object and the speed of the object.

The formula is

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?KE&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2}mv{2}) 

Where

- KE = kinetic energy in Joule
- m = mass of a body
- v = velocity of a body in meters/second

In addition, 1 Joule is 2.778·10⁻⁴ Wh

In all calculations on this page, we use the Audi e-tron 55 with a weight of 2900kg in the examples (car + driver). The below table shows how much kinetic energy this car will have in common speeds-

|Speed km/h | mph | m/s | Kinetic energy |
|----|-----|-----|-----|
| 50 kmh | 31.07 mph | 13.89 m/s |  0,077696331 kWh |
| 80 km/h | 49,7 mph | 22.222 m/s| 0.1989 kWh |
| 104.7km/h | 65 mph | 29.0575 m/s | 0.340083 kWh |
| 120.7km/h | 75 mph | 33.528 m/s | 0.452773 kWh |

You can use this [kinetic energy calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/kinetic-energy) for other speeds. See also the graph below.

### Rotational kinetic energy

In addition to the kinetic energy of the car itself, the wheels spinning on the car also contain rotational kinetic energy that can be regenerated.

The formula for rotational energy

![Formula](rotational_energy.svg)

- E is the rotational kinetic energy, expressed in Joules.
- I is the moment of inertia of the object, expressed in kg*m².
- ω is the angular velocity of the body, expressed in radians per second

For a wheel moment of inertia can be calculated

I = M * R²

For an Audi e-tron we do the calculation for the wheel option 265/40 R22. With an estimated weight of 30 kg per wheel and a radius of 38.54 cm you get

I = 30 * 0.3854^2 = 4,4559948

For 80km/h the wheel will spin with 566.89 rpm and the resulting kinetic energy would be 8.724333 Wh or 0,008724333 kWh for 4 wheels.

Note: This is not 100% correct since the formula is based on a wheel with the same form from center to edge. But it is close enough for this kind of calculation.

If you want to calculate you can try the [Rotational Kinetic Energy calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/rotational-kinetic-energy)

### Gravitational/Potential energy

Potential energy exists when the car is located at an elevated location compared to the destination.

The formula is quite simple.

![Gravity](gravitational_energy.svg)

- U: gravitational energy in joule
- m: mass in kg
- g: gravitational field 9.8 m/s^2 on surface
- h: height in meters

For example, the Audi e-tron 55 on 2900kg will located at 1000 meters (3280 feet) above sea level will have the potential energy of 7.8998 kWh (28.492.85 Joule)

In areas with elevation, the potential energy will be the biggest source of regenerated energy.

See [potential energy calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/potential-energy)

### Summary

The below graph shows the total kinetic energy and the two types of potential energy

## Understanding energy consumption

Before we give you example of how much energy that can be regenerated we need to explain energy consumption. Because this affects the result.

### Consumption by aerodynamic drag

A moving car will have forces based on air resistance that will push against the movement.

The formula for drag is:

![Drag](dragformula.png)

- P : Air density (1.225 on ground at 15 °C)
- u : Speed in meters
- A : Frontal area of the car (2.65m2 on Audi e-tron)
- CD: 0.28 on Audi e-tron 55

Based on this as an example. 80km/h requires power on 4.9kW (6.23kWh/100km) to overcome aerodynamic drag

Note that the power needed to push an object through a fluid increases as the cube of the velocity, so an Audi e-tron 55 traveling at 160km/h
requires 39,89903978 kw (24,93689986 kWh/100km) to overcome drag.

Temprature affect density. At -25 the density is 1.4224 and the consumption at 80 km/h increases to 7.23kWh/100km.

For all calculation on this page we assume 15 °C

### Rolling restiance

In addition to drag force there is rolling resistance from wheels and other drivetrain components that works against movement.

It is not easy to find this number, but with knowing the total consumption and the consumption caused by drag, and the efficency on the drivetrain it is possible to estimate the rolling restance on Audi e-tron.

Based on driver history it seems like driving on a dry road in 80 km/h in summer temprature requires around 19kWh/100km energy from the battery.
If we assume 85% effiency in the drivetrain we have an energy need on 16.15kWh/100km in total including drag.  If we take away energy need for drag we have around 9.915kWh/100km to overcome rolling restance.

This number is an estimate.

### Consumption summary

The below diagram show the calculated consumption needed to overcome drag and rolling resistance and consumption from battery based on 80% efficency in drivetrain. The real efficiency is now know but it is excpected to be around 80%.

## How much can be regenerated?

### Scenario 1: Pikes Peak

Lets take Pikes Peak as an example. This mountain 14.110 ft high but if you drive down the [first 18.6 miles](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Pikes+Peak,+Colorado+80809,+United+States/38.9057543,-104.9779289/@38.8779104,-105.0432721,10824m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!1m1!1s0x8714a806033005bd:0xa67b8c79d6580c1e!2m2!1d-105.0422595!2d38.8408707!1m0!3e0) you [have dropped 6538 ft](https://www.slashgear.com/audi-e-tron-pikes-peak-recuperation-challenge-first-drive-ev-tech-07540279/)  (1993 meters)

1993 meters for an Audi e-tron 55 at 2900kg is 15.74kWh in potential energy.

![Pikes Peak](pikespeak.jpg "Driving down Pikes Peak in Audi e-tron")

18.6 miles is 30 km. The speed down is low and based on rolling restiance and speed at 40km/h have an energy consumption at 13.1kWh/100km.

For 30km /18.6miles this means 3.9 kWh in total. This energy will be taken from the potential energy.

This means 11.84kWh to regenerate. With 80% effiency this would mean 9.5kWh back in to the battery.

In the video below you see a real world test of just exact this trip.

### Scenario 2: Fully stop from 75mph

In this scenario the car is moving at 75mph and need to make a full stop for a red light.

![Full stop](fullstop.jpg "Making a full stop from 75mph")

As listed in the table above 75mph for an 2900kg Audi e-tron gives a total kinetic energy of 182WH. 

### Scenario 3: Reduce speed from 75mph to 50 mph
