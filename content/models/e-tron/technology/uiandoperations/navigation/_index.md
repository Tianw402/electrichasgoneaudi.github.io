The navigation system on the Audi e-tron is based on [HERE Maps](https://www.here.com/strategic-alliances/audi/IVIdemo).

The navigation system is available in the [virtual cockpit](../virtualcockpit/), the [Head up display](../headupdisplay/), and [Audi MMi](../mmi/) and will help to navigate to your destination, but also will help find charging stations, parking, and other points of interestest along the route.

You can enable Google maps-based Satellite photos and google based search to enrich the experience.

Traffic information

## Additional benefits

- Calculate range more correctly when the destination is set based on information of the route
- Inform the [Efficent Assitant](/models/e-tron/technology/drivingassistance/predictiveefficiencyassist/) and [Adaptive Cruise Assist](/models/e-tron/technology/drivingassistance/adaptivecruiseassist/) about the road ahead so it can reduce speed based on information about the route or speed limit.
- Inform the driver assist systems about where you are going, so the car can take preventive measures like reducing speed before you are turning off a road.
- Tell the garage opener you are closing up to your garage so it can atomically select the correct garage door to open.

## Search & Route planning

You can plan routes from previous destinations, favorites, contact addresses, and receive destinations from the myAudi app.

In the below set of images, you see how it is to search and create a route going to IKEA from the MMI system.

The route planning supports up to 10 stopovers along a route.

## Range indication

The Navigation system also supports presenting the range on the map. The blue area is the theoretical range area.

## Voice guidance

You can get voice guidance during navigation.

## Traffic information

The Navigation system can receive real-time online traffic information about congestion, accidents, road construction, and other incidents.

By receiving traffic information, the Navigation System calculates a better route if available and the possible time saved compared to the current route.

A message will appear if the MMI calculates a better route for the current route guidance. The predicted delay takes into account future  changes to the traffic situation on the route. 

## Maps updates

Maps are automatically updated through [Audi Connect](/technology/audiconnect/). It requires a valid subscription to Audi Connect.

## GPS Antenna

The GPS antenna used by the navigation system is located on roof of e-tron
