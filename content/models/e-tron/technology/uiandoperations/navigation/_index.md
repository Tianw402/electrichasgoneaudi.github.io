The navigation system on the Audi e-tron is based on [HERE Maps](https://www.here.com/strategic-alliances/audi/IVIdemo).

The navigation system will help to navigate to your destination, but also will help find charging stations, parking, and other points of interestest along the route.

The navigation system is available in the [virtual cockpit](../virtualcockpit/), the [Head up display](../headupdisplay/), and [Audi MMi](../mmi/) and
will help to find your trip destination.

## Additional benefits

- Calculate range more correctly when the destination is set based on information of the route
- Inform the driver assist system about the road ahead so it can reduce speed based on information about the route or speed limit.
- Inform the driver assist systems about where you are going, so the car can take preventive measures like reducing speed before you are turning off a road.
