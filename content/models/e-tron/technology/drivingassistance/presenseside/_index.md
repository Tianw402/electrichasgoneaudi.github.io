 The system can detect the threat of side collisions at speeds of up to approx. 60 km/h (37.3 mph) and apply preventative measures to help protect occupants. These include: activating the hazard lights, tensioning the safety belts, optimizing the seating position, and closing windows as well as the optional panoramic glass roof.

![Audi Pre sense side](presenseside.jpg "In an impending lateral collision at more than 25 km/h (15.5 mph), the optional predictive active suspension raise the body on the side exposed to the danger by up to 80 millimeters (3.1 in)")

In an impending lateral collision at more than 25 km/h (15.5 mph), the suspension actuators of the optional Audi AI active suspension raise the body on the side exposed to the danger by up to 80 millimeters (3.1 in) within half a second. The other vehicle therefore hits the car in an even more impact-resistant zone. The side sills and floor structure accommodate a large portion of the impact forces. Deformation of the cabin and the loads acting on the occupants, above all to the chest and abdomen areas, are reduced by up to 50 percent compared with a lateral collision with no raising of the suspension.

## Other optional driver assystence systems

### Park assist

Park assist can automatically steer the car into parallel or perpendicular parking spaces. It uses ultrasonic sensors located in the front and rear bumpers and on the sides. The driver only has to accelerate, brake and shift gears.

The sensors measure parking spaces along the road while driving past them at moderate speed – a maximum of 20 km/h (12.4 mph) for perpendicular parking spaces and a maximum of 30 km/h (18.6 mph) for parallel spaces. A message appears on the MMI display when the system finds a suitable spot. The only actions required of the driver while parking are accelerating, shifting gears and braking. The system handles the steering. In addition, audible signals help the driver. Park assist will make multiple maneuvers, forwards and backwards, if necessary. It can also exit from parallel parking spaces. Depending on the model, the driver activates the system via either a button on the center console or a button in the lower infotainment display. The maximum speed for all maneuvers is 7 km/h (4.3 mph).

Park assist has option id **7X5** and is available as function on demand throug the myAudiApp

### 360 degree cameras

The four 360 degree cameras on the vehicle scan the immediate vicinity and display obstacles within. Drivers can choose from different views that simplify parking and maneuvering. A virtual overhead view shown in the MMI display gives the driver an overview of the overall parking situation. The panoramic view to the front and rear covers an angle of nearly 180 degrees and provides better visibility when exiting tight parking spaces, courtyard entrances and confusing intersections. Guide lines in the reversing camera view make it easier to park in perpendicular spaces and to hitch trailers. The view from the front camera helps when maneuvering, as it detects obstacles in front of the car. The system is automatically activated when driving in reverse or by pushing a button.

An additional feature for some models is a virtual 3D view. The driver can use the touchscreen to steplessly swivel and zoom the image of the car and the actual vehicle surroundings. There is also a view of the front or rear tires so that the driver can pull the car up right next to the curb.

### Curb warning

The curb warning identifies curbs that pose a risk to the tires or wheels. Prerequisite: The car is moving forward or backward at up to 10 km/h (6.2 mph). If the system detects a critical situation, it alerts the driver to this in the optical parking system display on the MMI monitor. To scan the surroundings the system uses primarily the 360 degree cameras.

### High-beam assist

High-beam assist utilizes a camera mounted on the interior mirror. It detects light sources – the headlights of oncoming vehicles, tail lights of other road users and the reflections of municipality limit signs, for instance – and automatically switches between high beam and low beam lighting. This provides for better visibility and a more relaxed driving experience. Drivers of oncoming vehicles are not blinded by glare.

### Maneuvering assist

Maneuvering assist recognizes moving and stationary objects larger than 10 centimeters (3.9 in), such as a pillar in a parking garage or a moving vehicle. It helps to avoid impending collisions using warning steering impulses and by autonomously braking the car to a stop, provided that the car is traveling forward or in reverse at no more than 10 km/h (6.2 mph). The system uses the optical parking system in the MMI to display its steering and parking interventions. The surroundings are scanned using at least the ultrasonic sensors and the 360 degree cameras.

### Reversing camera

![Reversing camera](rearviewcamera.jpg "Reversing camera")

The reversing camera simplifies maneuvering by showing the zone behind the vehicle on the MMI display. It shows the calculated driving track based on the steering angle as well as auxiliary lines and guide lines. For parallel parking, the latter lines precisely direct steering into the parking space in conjunction with steering reversal points. The blue pictured surface in the camera image indicates where the vehicle will be positioned after the parking procedure. The reversing camera is inconspicuously integrated into the handle trim strip of the luggage compartment lid. It is activated as soon as the driver engages reverse gear or pushes the respective button.
