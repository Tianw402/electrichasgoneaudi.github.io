The engine is started and switched off using the engine start-stop button in the center console. A high-quality visual differentiation on the top and bottom of the key through high-gloss black components and metal clasps in aluminum look make the innovative functions of the convenience key visible.

## Convenience key option PGC

The convenience key offers convenient control of access and engine start authorization without the key having to be actively operated

By operating the door handle, the vehicle can be opened without actively using the key. This is possible with all doors. The access authorization is confirmed by wireless communication between the key and the vehicle. To lock the vehicle from the outside, all you have to do is touch one of the sensor buttons on all door handles. The luggage compartment lid can be conveniently unlocked using the luggage compartment button on the convenience key or, if you do not have a free hand, with a foot gesture (kick movement) at the rear.
