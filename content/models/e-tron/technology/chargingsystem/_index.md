## e-tron charging System Connect

The new charging system connect, is also designed for a charging capacity of up to 22 kW from a industrial AC power outled.

It is designed for use at household outlets and can thus also be used when away from home. Using a suitable domestic installation, the e-tron 55 models can be fully charged in just under five hours. 

The charging system connect comprises an operating unit with a 5-inch touch display and a wall mount.

Its Wi-Fi internet connection enables both control via the myAudi app and function updates.

Audi recommends a three-phase, 400-volt outlet for optimal use of the charging system connect. If desired, an electrician referred by the local Audi dealer will check the power supply and install the suitable technology as needed.

In conjunction with a compatible home energy management system from SMA Solar Technology or the Hager Group, the e-tron charging system connect offers additional, intelligent functions. 

For example, the Audi e-tron can take account of the needs of other consumers in the household and charge with the remaining power available in order to avoid overloading the home electrical system. 

The charging system also allows customers to define individual priorities, such as charging when electricity is less expensive under a variable electricity rate. 

If the home is equipped with a photovoltaic system, the car can be charged preferentially using the electricity generated by the system. Charging planning then considers forecast periods of sunshine.
Additional features of the e-tron charging system connect include PIN protection against unauthorized use and the recording of charging energy.

## Use with caution

The charging systems for is meant for emergency charging when no hardwired option is available. 

Using the same outlet over time casues stress to the outlet and there is high risk for meltdown. Below you see some pictures of outlets that melted for e-tron owners that did not
install a hardwired charging system. This is not a specific Audi issue, but relevant for all EV that charge with high current.
