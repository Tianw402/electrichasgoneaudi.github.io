In conjunction with a compatible home energy management system from SMA Solar Technology or the Hager Group, the e-tron charging system connect offers additional, intelligent functions. 

For example, the Audi e-tron can take account of the needs of other consumers in the household and charge with the remaining power available in order to avoid overloading the home electrical system. 

The charging system also allows customers to define individual priorities, such as charging when electricity is less expensive under a variable electricity rate. 

If the home is equipped with a photovoltaic system, the car can be charged preferentially using the electricity generated by the system. Charging planning then considers forecast periods of sunshine.
Additional features of the e-tron charging system connect include PIN protection against unauthorized use and the recording of charging energy.
