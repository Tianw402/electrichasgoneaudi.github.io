## Trailer

Audi e-tron can drag trailers up to 1800kg. You can expect the consumption to go up depending on size on trailer

### Trailer example 1

In this example the owner pulled a 1800kg trailer with boat. The consumption ended up on 52.5kWh/100km over a distance
on 568.1km. This gives an theoretical range on 164km.

In miles it is 1.9miles/kWh and range on 101.
