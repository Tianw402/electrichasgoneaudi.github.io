### MY 2023 (from summer 2022)

This is the first real facelift version of e-tron. It is expected to have a larger battery. What kind of size is currently not confirmed but one theory is that
they will replace the 432 60AH cells in a 108s4p configuration with a 108s3p configuration with Samsung 94AH cells. In total 324 cells on the e-tron 55.

This will keep the nominal voltage at 397 volts but increase gross capacity from 95kWh to 112kWh.  If 108kWh is made available this would increase range
to 461 - 565km depending on equipment trim this from the current range on 369-452km depending on equipment trim.

For the e-tron 50 they could in theory offer a version with 108s2p with only 74kWh gross battery. But this is not likely.

In addition, you could expect some other technical improvements that slightly would reduce consumption. The current minimum WLTP consumption is 19.1 kWh/100km.
If they are able to reduce this to 18.5 you could see rated range up to 580km.

But all is unconfirmed. Will be updated when we know more.
