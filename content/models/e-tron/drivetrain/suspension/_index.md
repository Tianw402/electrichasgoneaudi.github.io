## Adaptive air suspension

The adaptive air suspension – an air suspension system with controlled damping – offers a wide range between smooth cruising and sporty handling. Depending on the speed and the driver’s preferences, it individually adjusts the ride height according to the road conditions. The air suspension also offers level control as a function of load.

The system is designed differently for the different individual product lines. In the front suspension struts, air springs enclose the shock absorbers. In most models, these two components are implemented separately in the rear suspension. In the Audi A8 (2017), however, pneumatic struts are also mounted on the rear suspension. The mounting orientation of the compressor and the number of pressure reservoirs to be filled also differ, depending on the model.

The central chassis control unit, the electronic chassis platform (ECP), individually controls the function of the shock absorbers on each wheel at cycles in the order of milliseconds – according to the road surface condition, driving style and the mode the driver sets in the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. Solenoid damper valves vary the volumetric flow of the hydraulic fluid.
