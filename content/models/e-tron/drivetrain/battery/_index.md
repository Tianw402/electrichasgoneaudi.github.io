### Samsung SDI

After january 2021 Audi replaced the battery cells on e-tron 55 batteries with [Samsung SDI cells](https://www.electrive.net/2020/07/23/audi-chef-duesmann-sieht-batterie-probleme-beim-e-tron-als-geloest/). This is belived mainly to be becuase of LG focused on other cells to other VAG cars.

## Battery e-tron 60S and Audi e-tron 55

The battery for Audi e-tron 55/e-tron 60S is totally on 95kWh and 396 volt and have the part number  1 AX2
It has totally 36 modules with 12 cells each that gives totally 432 cells.

### Battery pack capacity

Each cell is on 60ah and is 3.666666 nominal volt
In each module the cells are grouped in 4 cells. The cells are coupled in paralell
giving it 60ah + 60ah + 60ah + 60ah = 240ah capacitance.

The 3 groups with 4 cells are then coupled in serial. Giving it 3.66V + 3.66V + 3,66 volt giving it 11 nominal voltage for each module.

The total nominal voltage is 11 * 36 = 396 volt

396 volt * 240ah = 95.040 kWh capacitiy.

Each module weighs aprox 13kg.

Total battery weight is 1532.2lb (699,99 kg)

For models produced before week 47 in 2019, available battery is 83.6 kWh.
For models produced after that the buffer has been decreased so available is 86.5 kWh increasing the range with 3,4%. 

Max charging speed is 150kW.

### Battery Audi e-tron 50

The battery for Audi e-tron 50 is totaly on 71kWh and 
It has totally 27 modules with 12 cells each that gives totally 324 cells
3.68 x 60ah x  324 cells = 71.5 kWh.

![e-tron 50 battery](etron50battery.jpg "e-tron 50 battery")

Max charging speed is 120kW.

The cells are produced by Samsung SDI in [Budapest, Hungary](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Samsung+SDI+Hungary+Zrt./@47.6765476,19.168821,2130m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x45db42011a2687d9!8m2!3d47.6779532!4d19.170087)

They are of type [Samsung Prismatic](https://www.samsungsdi.com/automotive-battery/products/prismatic-lithium-ion-battery-cell.html)

Each cell is on 60ah and is 3.67 volt
In each module the cells are grouped in 3 cells. The cells are coupled in paralell
giving it 60ah + 60ah + 60ah = 180ah capacitance.
