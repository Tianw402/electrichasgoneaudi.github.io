### Battery Audi e-tron 55

The battery for Audi e-tron is totally on 95kWh and 396 volt and have the part number  1 AX2
It has totally 36 modules with 12 cells each that gives totally 432 cells. 

The cell type is [LG Pouch Cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Lczd7MjGc) produced in [Poland](https://www.google.no/maps/search/lg+chem+poland/@51.0183429,16.8906359,995m/data=!3m1!1e3). It is based on [NMC 622 technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery)

**UPDATE AUGUST 2020: AUDI has from [August 2020 started using Samung Prismatic cells also in some E-55](https://www.electrive.net/2020/07/23/audi-chef-duesmann-sieht-batterie-probleme-beim-e-tron-als-geloest/). Currently we dont how this will affect performance**

Each cell is on 60ah and is 3.67 volt
In each module the cells are grouped in 4 cells. The cells are coupled in paralell
giving it 60ah + 60ah + 60ah + 60ah = 240ah capacitance.

The 3 groups with 4 cells are then coupled in serial. Giving it 3.66V + 3.66V + 3,66 volt giving it 11 volt for each module

11 volt * 240ah * 36 cells = 95.040 kWh capacitiy. 

36 modules a 11 volt is then coupled in serial giving it 396 volt in total.

Total battery weight is 1532.2lb (699,99 kg)

For models produced before week 47 in 2019, available battery is 83.6 kWh.
For models produced after that the buffer has been decreased so available is 86.5 kWh increasing the range with 3,4%. 

Max charging speed is 150kW.

### Battery Audi e-tron 50

The battery for Audi e-tron 50 is totaly on 71kWh and 
It has totally 27 modules with 12 cells each that gives totally 324 cells
3.68 x 60ah x  324 cells = 71.5 kWh.

Max charging speed is 120kW.

The cells are produced by Samsung SDI in [Budapest, Hungary](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Samsung+SDI+Hungary+Zrt./@47.6765476,19.168821,2130m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x45db42011a2687d9!8m2!3d47.6779532!4d19.170087)

They are of type [Samsung Prismatic](https://www.samsungsdi.com/automotive-battery/products/prismatic-lithium-ion-battery-cell.html)

Each cell is on 60ah and is 3.67 volt
In each module the cells are grouped in 3 cells. The cells are coupled in paralell
giving it 60ah + 60ah + 60ah = 180ah capacitance.

The 4 groups with 3 cells are then coupled in serial. Giving it 3.66V + 3.66V + 3,66  +3.66 volt giving it 14.66 volt for each module
