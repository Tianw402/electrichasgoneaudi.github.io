The Sline exterior package contains additional styling elements. In contrast to the basic model, the attachments on the S line exterior are
painted in the exterior body color â€“ including the wheel arch trims, door sills, bumpers and exterior mirrors. Audi also offers the black styling package that
accentuates the area of the Singleframe, the side windows, and the bumper. The exterior mirror housings are also available in black as an option.

## S-line exterior

The more distinctively contoured bumper is flanked by more expressive air curtains, which improve the air flow. They
extend below the headlights, thereby creating a dynamic appearance even from a distance. An S line emblem adorns the radiator grille, while the
illuminated aluminum door sill trims feature an #S logo.

## S exterior

 The front bumper features a striking design and the integrated air curtains are larger and more expressive. The wheel arches on both sides are a full 23 millimeters (0.9 in) wider and
 the diffuser insert in the rear bumper extends almost across the entire width of the rear end. Silver elements add highlights all over the car, from the lip of the front bumper and the
 Singleframe and all the way to the diffuser insert.
 
 The door inserts and housings of the exterior mirrors are made of aluminum, and the front and rear end are decorated with S badges. Audi can paint attachments like the front lip, wheel arches and sill trims in a contrasting color upon request.
