## Bang & Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound

The Bang & Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound offers a fascinating feature for hi-fi fans – sound that includes the spatial dimension of height. It accomplishes this via several additional loudspeakers. The interior is transformed into a broad sound stage where the music unfolds exactly as it was recorded in the concert hall – without any artificial effects. Behind this technology is an algorithm that Audi developed in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute in Erlangen. It takes stereo or 5.1 recordings, computes the information for the third dimension and conditions it for the 3D loudspeakers.

In its top version the Bang & Olufsen Sound System implements 3D sound in the rear seating area too. Using the MMI system and a separate control unit for the rear passengers, depending on the model, the sound setting can be optimized to personal preferences – with a focus on either the front or rear seats, or on all seats.

The illustration below show where the 16 different speakers are located.
