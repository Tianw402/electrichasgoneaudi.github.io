## Auxiliary air conditioner

Audi e-tron GT is equipped with an auxiliary air conditioner that can be used when the car is turned off. This can be activated
from MMI manual or set by a timer. One typical use case is when charging since the car needs to be turned off then and the main AC unit does not work.

The auxiliary air conditioner can also be controlled by the myAudi app. This is useful when you need to heat or cool the car before using it.

When you are DC charging the Auxiliary air conditioner can run in 60 minutes.
