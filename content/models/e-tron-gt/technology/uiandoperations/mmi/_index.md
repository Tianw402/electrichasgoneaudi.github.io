Eleven antennas, all of which are integrated where they cannot be seen, connect the e-tron GT with the outside world. They receive and transmit audio, LTE, Bluetooth, and GPS signals; the fully electric gran turismo is connected in many different ways.

### Fast data transfer: MMI navigation plus

The e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT come as standard with the MMI navigation plus information center, which supports the high-speed data transmission standard LTE Advanced and includes a Wi-Fi hotspot for the passengers’ mobile devices. The navigation system makes destination suggestions based on previous routes and provides lane-specific information on the traffic flow. The route is calculated both in the car and online on the servers of service provider HERE. It uses real-time data on the overall traffic situation, which enables predictive planning.

The Audi connect online services are split into two packages. The Audi connect navigation & infotainment package includes services such as traffic information online, navigation with Google Earth™, online radio, hybrid radio, and the Amazon Alexa voice assistant, which allows access to several thousands of Alexa skills. Car-to-X services can warn the driver about hazards such as road ice and help them to find free parking spots on the roadside or allow them to surf the green wave by communicating with traffic lights.

### Intelligent calculation: the e-tron route planner



The e-tron route planner – yet another service from Audi connect – calculates the fastest route with the shortest possible charging stops. While doing so, it calculates the overall travel time, i.e. the driving time and the charging time, and takes forecasts regarding the traffic situation and availability of charging points into account. In any case, it plans the sections between the charging stops such that the driver arrives at their destination as quickly as possible. To do this, it may suggest charging twice with high power instead of one long stop with lower power. The directory of charging points is updated every day.

The second area of the service program includes Audi connect emergency call & service with Audi connect remote & control. Here, the customer can control many functions via the myAudi app on their smartphone. Aside from charging and climate control, these functions include querying the vehicle status, the car finder, or locking and unlocking. Services such as Audi connect emergency call, online roadside assistance, and Audi service request complement the portfolio.

Attractive hardware modules supplement the infotainment portfolio. The Audi phone box (optional for both models) links smartphones to the vehicle’s antenna and charges them inductively. The Bang & Olufsen premium sound system (standard in the RS model ) ups the ante with an output of 710 watts. Among its 16 loudspeakers are two 3D loudspeakers in the A-pillars.
