The battery for Audi e-tron and RS e-tron GT is totally on 93.4kWh. It has totally 33 modules with 12 cells each that gives totally 396 cells.

## Battery housing

The waterproof housing is a sandwich construction consisting of a cover at the top and a bulkhead plate at the bottom. The truss-design battery frame with multiple subdivisions is mounted in between. The cooling elements are glued on underneath the bulkhead plate.

The battery housing is secured by means of a steel protective plate. For the battery frame, the developers opted for a lightweight aluminium design. On the one hand, this provides a lot of installation space for the cell modules - and consequently a high battery capacity. On the other hand, this has made it possible for the vehicle weight to be kept low. Modern joining techniques are used such as MIG welding (metal welding with inert gases) on the battery frame, laser welding on the bulkhead and protection plates and heat-conducting adhesive on the line system under the battery (see below).

## Battery pack capacity

The confiugration of the battery cells are 198s2p, meaning there is two and two cells in paralell with 196 pairs in serial.

Audi/Porsche rates the capacity to each cell to 64.6 or 129.2 per cell pair.

The nominal voltage is 198 * 3.65151515 = 723 Volt.

723 volt * 129.2 gives = 93400Wh or 93.4kWh as stated.

Fully charged it cell 4.217 Volt in total 835Voltage. Empty each cell has 3.08 volt giving in a pack voltage on 610 Volt.

Total battery weight is 630 kg (1389 pound).

Each module weighs aprox 13kg.

Max charging speed is 270kW.
