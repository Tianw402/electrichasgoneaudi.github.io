## Sport Plus Seats

Upholstery is available either as a combination of artificial leather and the Kaskade material or as a mixture of mono.pur 550 artificial leather and the microfiber material Dinamica. In both cases, the covers consist predominantly of materials such as polyester fibers that were made from recycled PET bottles, textiles, or residual fibers. Each set of Kaskade covers is made of 119 recycled plastic bottles. Dinamica is a breathable microfiber material made proportionally from recycled polyester fibers and recycled PET. Kaskade is reminiscent of natural fibers such as wool and offers a very pleasant seating feel. The stitching of the seat center panels of both covers is based on the look of the Singleframe.

For the Color & Trim concept of the Audi e-tron GT the materials were completely redefined and a leather-free interior was developed. This video shows how the fabric Kaskade was developed for the Audi e-tron GT.
