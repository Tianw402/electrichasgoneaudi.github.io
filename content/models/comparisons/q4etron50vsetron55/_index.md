## Introduction

Audi e-tron 55 was Audi's first all-electric model, and it is based on the [MLB-Evo](../../../technology/bev-platforms/mlb-evo/) platform. Traditional models also use that. It was first presented in 2018.  

The Audi Q4 e-tron 50 was presented in 2021 and is based on a dedicated EV platform called [MEB](../../../technology/bev-platforms/meb/). This platform was created by Volkswagen and used by several models.

## Consumption
