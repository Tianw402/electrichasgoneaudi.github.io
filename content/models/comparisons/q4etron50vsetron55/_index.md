## Introduction

Audi e-tron 55 was Audi's first all-electric model, and it is based on the [MLB-Evo](../../../technology/bev-platforms/mlb-evo/) platform. Traditional models also use that. It was first presented in 2018.  

The Audi Q4 e-tron 50 was presented in 2021 and is based on a dedicated EV platform called [MEB](../../../technology/bev-platforms/meb/). This platform was created by Volkswagen and used by several models.

## Consumption

According to the specification, the consumption is 25% higher on Audi e-tron 55 compared to Audi 40 e-tron 50. In reality, you can see up to 35% difference in consumption. The main reasons for this are smaller tires on the Q4 e-tron 50, more efficient motors, less weight, and a smaller size that causes less aerodynamical drag.

## Range

Because of the low consumption, the Q4 e-tron 50 has a longer range even though the battery is 12% smaller. As a result, the range difference would, in most driving conditions, be 10-15% better on the Audi Q4 e-tron 50 compared to a similar equipped Audi e-tron 55.

In the real world, depending on weather and driving style, the range on the Audi e-tron 55 would be between 250-450km, while on the Audi Q4 e-tron, the range would be 300-500km in similar conditions.

## Performance

The Audi e-tron 55 has 408 hp, and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 299 hp. For Q4 e-tron 50, the full power is only available when fully charged and above 23 degrees, while the full power is available in much larger areas for the e-tron. Since the weight I lower on the Q4 e-tron, the difference feels smaller and is probably small enough not to make it the deciding factor between the models.

## Size

The Audi e-tron is 313 mm longer and 81 mm wider than Q4. The smaller size makes the Q4 more flexible in traffic and parking situations.

The size difference can be a deciding argument for Q4 for many people.

## Cargo capacity

The cargospace on e-tron is about 27% larger on e-tron than Q4. Q4 does not have any frunk, like Audi e-tron.

e-tron can pull a trailer up to 1800kg, while Q4 only have 1200kg trailer capacitiy.

## Exterior

Both Audi e-tron 55 and Audi Q4 e-tron is available with many different standard colors. They can both be equipped with differen wheels, different optics, panoramic roof, s-line exterior and more. Audi e-tron can also be delivered with Audi exclusive colors in addition to the standard colors. But it comes at a cost and probably not something that would be a deciding factor.  

## Interior

There is a more significant difference for the interior. Both models are available with standard and s sports seats. But the Audi e-tron has, in addition, sports seats and comfort seats. Comfort seats are available with massage and ventilation. 

## Driving assistance

Both models are available with almost the same driver-assist systems. However, there is a difference in what is standard. Night vision is only available on e-tron. 

## Infotainment

This has some drawbacks since you loose some functionality available on the second screen and other functionality needs to be put on one screen instead of two, like the navigation search.

For some, the physical buttons for the AC on Q4 are an advantage.

## Lights

Both models can be delivered with HD matrix. In addition, Q4 has some fabulous new daylight driving lights as an option where drivers can select a different design.

## Standard equipment and available options

Audi Q4 e-tron 50 has a lower starting price. Much of this difference is because of equipment that is standard on e-tron and not on Q4. 

Example

- MMI navigation

- Virtual cockpit
