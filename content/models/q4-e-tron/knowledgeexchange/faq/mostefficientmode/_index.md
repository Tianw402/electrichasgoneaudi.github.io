On the Audi Q4 e-tron, there are two drive modes available.

- **D-mode** : car coast when lifting the watt pedal (power)
- **B-mode (brake)** : car reduces speed while it recuperates energy when lifting the watt pedal (power)

May owners ask questions about what is most efficient.

The answer is **D-mode**. The reason is that in B-mode you will be ending up recuperating when not needed and that will lose energy during the conversion of kinetic energy to electric energy on the battery. Around 80% of the kinetic energy is put into the battery while recuperating.
If you coast you will keep that energy as kinetic energy.

To be able to coast in B-mode you would need to hold foot on the throttle on a specific location, but even the best driver will not be able to shift between driving and coasting at the same speed as in D-mode.

On other cars, B-mode would be more efficient, but Audi has created blended brakes that always do recuperate when pressing the brake pedal if possible. That's why you don't  waste  energy using the brake pedal on the Audi Q4 e-tron.

Note:  If “dynamic” mode is set in the optional [Audi drive select dynamic handling system](../../../technology/audidriveselect/) (standard in the Sportback), recuperation also takes place in gear D but at a slightly weaker rate than in B.

## How much does it matter?

Even D-mode is the most efficient in most cases the differences could be ignored. If you prefer driving with B-mode in the city (one-pedal-driving) you should just do it.
The extra range you get from D-mode in the city driving probably is not something you would care about.

On high-way it is much more comfortable to use D-mode in addition to being  more efficient.
