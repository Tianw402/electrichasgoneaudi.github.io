The Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron include a wide range of drives – from the city cruiser to the powerful quattro. They are being launched on the European markets with two different battery sizes and three motor line-ups. In the Q4 35 e-tron and Q4 40 e-tron a permanently excited synchronous machine (PSM) on the rear wheels provides the drive – these two models, along with the R8 V10 RWD high-performance sports car, are the only series-production Audi models with purely rear-wheel drive. The Q4 45 e-tron and the Q4 50 e-tron quattro as the sporty top model uses two electric motors for its electric all-wheel drive.

## Entry-level model: the Q4 35 e-tron

The entry-level models Audi Q4 35 e-tron are equipped with the compact battery that has a net energy content of 52 kWh (55 kWh gross). An electric motor with an output of 125 kW (170 PS) and
torque of 310 Nm provides the drive. In both body variants, it accelerates the electric SUV from 0 to 100 km/h in 9.0 seconds and produces a governed top speed of 160 km/h.
The Q4 35 e-tron can cover up to 341 kilometers (211.9 mi) (WLTP cycle) on a single battery charge, while the Q4 Sportback 35 e-tron does up to 349 kilometers (216.9 mi) (WLTP).

## Range of up to 520 kilometers (323.1 mi): the Q4 40 e-tron

The Audi Q4 40 e-tron features the large battery, which stores a net 76.6 kWh of energy (82 kWh gross).
The electric motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm in this configuration. It is the same motor (APP310) used.

## Entry model with two electric motors: the Q4 45 e-tron quattro

The Q4 45 e-tron quattro run on the 76.6 kWh battery (82 kWh gross). It supplies two electric motors that combine to produce a maximum output of 195 kW (265 PS) and 460 Nm (339.3 lb-ft) of torque, while making electric all-wheel drive become a reality. 

## Top model with two electric motors: the Q4 50 e-tron quattro

The top models Q4 50 e-tron quattro and Q4 Sportback 50 e-tron quattro also run on the 77 kWh battery (82 kWh gross). It supplies two electric motors that combine to produce a maximum output of 220 kW (299 PS)(Maximum output determined according to UN-GTR.21.) and 460 Nm (339.3 lb-ft) of torque, while making electric all-wheel drive become a reality. The rear motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm, the front motor 80 kW (109 PS) and 162 Nm. The electric motors keep reserves available for certain driving situations, which is why the sum of their individual outputs exceeds the drive’s total output.

The full power is only available above 80% SOC. After that it will drop down against 265HP. This screenshot show how the boost level is about 50% at 66% SOC.

## Motor technology

While there are three motor configurations there are only two types of electric motors used on Q4 e-tron

### Rear electric motor

It is the same rear electric motor on all versions of Q4, but it perform different
on Q35 vs Q40/Q45/Q50 because of different battery pack. The rear electric motor has the following specifictions.

- axial parallel achitecture
- PSM motor with hairpin winding
- 150 kW / 310 Nm
- liquid cooled
- max. rotor speed: 16.000 rpm
- single speed gearbox
- two-stage speed reduction (13:1 RWD / 11.5:1 AWD)
- weight: ~90 kg

### Front electric motor

Only Q5 45 Quattro and 50 Quattro has the front motor. The front electric motor has the following specifictions.

- coaxial architecture
- ASM motor with distributed pull-in winding
- Aluminum rotor
- 80 kW / 162 Nm
- liquid cooled
- max. rotor speed: 14.000 rpm
- single speed gearbox
- two-stage speed reduction (~10:1)
- weight: ~60 kg

The principal advantages of the ASM are its short-term overload capacity and the minimal drag losses while idling. For efficiency reasons the front e-axle comes into action only when high power or a strong grip is needed.
