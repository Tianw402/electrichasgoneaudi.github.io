The Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron include a wide range of drives – from the city cruiser to the powerful quattro. They are being launched on the European markets with two different battery sizes and three motor line-ups. In the Q4 35 e-tron and Q4 40 e-tron a permanently excited synchronous machine (PSM) on the rear wheels provides the drive – these two models, along with the R8 V10 RWD high-performance sports car, are the only series-production Audi models with purely rear-wheel drive. The Q4 50 e-tron quattro as the sporty top model uses two electric motors for its electric all-wheel drive.

## Entry-level model: the Q4 35 e-tron

The entry-level models Audi Q4 35 e-tron are equipped with the compact battery that has a net energy content of 52 kWh (55 kWh gross). An electric motor with an output of 125 kW (170 PS) and
torque of 310 Nm provides the drive. In both body variants, it accelerates the electric SUV from 0 to 100 km/h in 9.0 seconds and produces a governed top speed of 160 km/h.
The Q4 35 e-tron can cover up to 341 kilometers (211.9 mi) (WLTP cycle) on a single battery charge, while the Q4 Sportback 35 e-tron does up to 349 kilometers (216.9 mi) (WLTP).

The average energy consumption in WLTP, depending on trim version, is 19.1 to 17.0 kWh per 100 kilometers (62.1 mi) (WLTP) for the Q4 35 e-tron and 18.6 to 16.6 kWh for the Q4 Sportback 35 e-tron.

## Range of up to 520 kilometers (323.1 mi): the Q4 40 e-tron

The Audi Q4 40 e-tron features the large battery, which stores a net 77 kWh of energy (82 kWh gross). 
The electric motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm in this configuration. It is the same motor (APP310) used. 

A standard sprint takes 8.5 seconds, and here, too, the propulsion tops 
out at a speed of 160 km/h. One charge is enough for up to 520 kilometers (WLTP). According to WLTP the Audi Q4 40 e-tron uses an 
average of 19.3 to 17.3 kWh per 100 kilometers (62.1 mi).

## Top model with two electric motors: the Q4 50 e-tron quattro

The top models Q4 50 e-tron quattro and Q4 Sportback 50 e-tron quattro also run on the 77 kWh battery (82 kWh gross). It supplies two electric motors that combine to produce a maximum output of 220 kW (299 PS)(Maximum output determined according to UN-GTR.21.) and 460 Nm (339.3 lb-ft) of torque, while making electric all-wheel drive become a reality. The rear motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm, the front motor 80 kW (109 PS) and 162 Nm. The electric motors keep reserves available for certain driving situations, which is why the sum of their individual outputs exceeds the drive’s total output.

Both model variants sprint from a standing start to highway speed in 6.2 seconds and continue on to reach a top speed of 180 km/h. They have ranges of up to 488 and 497 (Sportback) kilometers respectively in WLTP. The average energy consumption for the Q4 50 e-tron quattro in WLTP is 19.9 to 17.9 kWh. The Sportback, which is available optionally with distinctly sporty tires, consumes 20.9 to 17.6 kWh.
