Just as in all of its models, Audi relies on a fully digital operating and display concept with a flat menu structure in the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. 

It comprises four levels: the digital instrument cluster or Audi virtual cockpit for the driver, the central MMI touch display, the natural-language voice control, 
and the optional augmented reality head-up display â€“ it is a new, pioneering piece of technology.
