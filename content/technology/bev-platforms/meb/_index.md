The MEB provides the technical basis for the future compact and medium-size class models from Audi.
This platform thus provides the entry point into the electric model portfolio of the brand with
the four rings

By using the group-wide MEB platform, Audi can offer its customers affordable yet technically
sophisticated electric models with the unmistakable Audi DNA. Fascinating design, highquality interior workmanship and a top-of-the-line operating system. The use of maximum platform synergies in the Group makes electric mobility attractive to many new customers in
the compact segment. The modular electric drive platform of the Volkswagen Group is designed to be highly versatile and scalable to a high degree. Its matrix extends from SUVs and crossover models all the way to sedans.

As it is designed exclusively for electric drives, the MEB allows customers to experience all the
advantages that compact electric motors and lithium-ion batteries in different sizes and capacities offer. The battery systems, electric motors and axle designs form a stringent technology toolkit.

In contrast to the current models with combustion engines, the front
section is considerably shorterâ€”the front axle and firewall move forward, making the
wheelbase and thus the usable interior space considerably larger.

In March 2019, Audi announced the Q4 e-tron concept with a near-production-level showcar at
the Geneva Motor Show. It will be the first Audi based on the MEB platform to roll off the line:
A compact SUV that fits into the same segment as the conventionally motorized Q3. Its
exterior length of 4.59 meters (15.1 ft) places it in the upper third of the compact class;
thanks to its wheelbase of 2.76 meters (9.1 ft), however, its interior is at least at the level of
the medium-size class. 

In terms of interior length, each MEB model thus corresponds to a
current vehicle from the next higher category. While the exterior dimensions of the Q4 e-tron
concept are comparable to those of the Q3, it offers the interior dimensions of a Q5. The
architecture of the dashboard also offers new design opportunities.
Of course the MEB platform also offers different performance levels and drive layouts. In
addition to the typical quattro all-wheel drive with an electric motor at the front and rear axles,
there will also be a drive variant with a rear-mounted engine and rear-wheel drive for the entrylevel variants.
