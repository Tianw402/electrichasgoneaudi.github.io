The Premium Platform Electric (PPE) has been designed and developed in cooperation with Porsche from the
start. Porsche will use it for their upcoming Porsche Macan, while Audi will use it for [Audi Q6 e-tron](../../../models/q6-e-tron/)
and [A6 e-tron](../../../models/a6-e-tron/) and others.

With its special architecture, it provides the conditions needed for ultra-modern
technology that satisfies the demanding customer requests in the full-size and luxury class
segments.

PPE will take on the role in the world of electric vehicles that the modular longitudinal
platform holds in vehicles powered by combustion engines. It is characterized by a high-tech
and highly scalable architecture that allows both low- and high-floor vehicles to be realized.

Audi is developing various model series based on PPE that will cover the segments from
the upper medium-size class to the luxury class as SUVs, Sportbacks, Avants and Crossovers with various different vehicle types. 

In doing so, the brand is also expanding its current model portfolio in the full-size class and luxury segments by adding numerous electric variants.

The diagram below show hows PPE models will be compared to J1 and MEB models in various aspects.

## Battery

Like in the Audi e-tron GT, the battery will be 800 volts; in combination with high-efficiency thermal management, it enables a
high charging capacity of up to 270 kW.

All-electric models based on PPE will be delivered with different battery sizes over time. Audi A6 e-tron and Audi Q6 e-tron
will be deliveres with two different configurations when they are launced.

- 12 modules with 100 kWh gross (94kWh net)
- 10 modules with 83.3kWh gross (78kWh net).

![Battery](battery.png "PPE-battery with 12 modules")

The cells will be [prismatic](../../battery/cell/#prismatic-housing) and each module is expected to have 34 cells on 67AH.

This gives the following [battery architecture](../../battery/batterysystem/#architecture).

- 204s2p and 737Volt nominal for the 12 module version
- 170s2p and 614Volt nominal for the 10 module version

More battery sizes will come at a later time.
For the [Audi grandshpere concept](../../../articles/audigrandsphereconcept/) Audi uses a PPE platform with 120kWh battery.

## Motors and performance

The technology package on the PPE is generally similar to that of the MEB; in addition, it offers
great potential in terms of output and performance. As standard, the vehicles are fitted with
one electric motor in the rear; the top-of-the-range models are equipped with a second electric
motor at the front axle (PSM or ASM) that allows them to activate all-wheel drive
automatically when needed.

If will of course also be possible to realize different performance
levels and battery capacities on the PPE platform. Models based on PPE will be delivered with different motor setups in combination with the small and large batteries.

The models will have from around 300HP to close to 700HP depending on setup.

The dimensions and overhangs of the low-floor Audi models on the PPE platform will be
slightly shorter than those of the current combustion engine models on MLB basis but will
offer greater interior length. As is typical for electric models, there are no transmission or
center tunnels. As traditional premium vehicles, the PPE models can be equipped with
numerous high-end technologies: In the drive area, torque control takes place via torque
vectoring, while the typical Audi features of air suspension or all-wheel steering are provided in
the suspension area.

## Models expected to be on the PPE platform

- [Audi Q6 e-tron](../../../models/q6-e-tron) Confirmed
- [Audi SQ6 e-tron](../../../models/q6-e-tron) UnConfirmed
- [Audi A6 e-tron](../../../models/a6-e-tron) Confirmed

## PPE vs MLB evo

In 2020 Audi had a presentation where they discussed some of the improvments of the new platform over the MLB evo platform.
