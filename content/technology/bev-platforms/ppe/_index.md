The Premium Platform Electric (PPE) has been designed and developed in cooperation with Porsche from the
start.

 With its special architecture, it provides the conditions needed for ultra-modern
technology that satisfies the demanding customer requests in the full-size and luxury class
segments.
PPE will take on the role in the world of electric vehicles that the modular longitudinal
platform holds in vehicles powered by combustion engines. It is characterized by a high-tech
and highly scalable architecture that allows both low- and high-floor vehicles to be realized.
Audi is developing various model series on the basis of PPE that will cover the segments from
the upper medium-size class to the luxury class as SUVs, Sportbacks, Avants and Crossovers

with various different vehicle types. In doing so, the brand is also expanding its current model
portfolio in the full-size class and luxury segments by adding numerous electric variants.
The technology package on the PPE is generally similar to that of the MEB; in addition, it offers
great potential in terms of output and performance. As standard, the vehicles are fitted with
one electric motor in the rear; the top-of-the-range models are equipped with a second electric
motor at the front axle (PSM or ASM) that allows them to activate all-wheel drive
automatically when needed. If will of course also be possible to realize different performance
levels and battery capacities on the PPE platform. Like in the Audi e-tron GT concept, the state
of charge is 800 volts; in combination with high-efficiency thermal management, it enables a
high charging capacity of 350 kW.
The dimensions and overhangs of the low-floor Audi models on the PPE platform will be
slightly shorter than those of the current combustion engine models on MLB basis but will
offer greater interior length. As is typical for electric models, there are no transmission or
center tunnels. As traditional premium vehicles, the PPE models can be equipped with
numerous high-end technologies: In the drive area, torque control takes place via torque
vectoring, while the typical Audi features of air suspension or all-wheel steering are provided in
the suspension area.
