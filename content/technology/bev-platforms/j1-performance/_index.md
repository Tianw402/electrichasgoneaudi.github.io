Audi presented the e-tron GT concept showcar at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show, offering a near-production-level outlook on the future high-performance Gran Turismo. The e-tron GT concept functions as a “signature car” for the brand with the four rings and demonstrates 

mpressively how emotional electric mobility can be. It sparks customers’ enthusiasm with its
sporty and emotional design and provides a fascinating technological experience.

Audi is using the J1 performance platform developed by Porsche as the technical basis.

The Audi e-tron GT concept showcar is equipped with two permanently excited synchronous 
machines (PSM) that output a system performance of 590 metric hp (434 kW) and 830 Nm 
(612.2 lb-ft) of torque. The four-door GT is propelled from zero to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 
3.5 seconds and reaches 200 km/h (124.3 mph) in just over 12 seconds, before propulsion 
ends at 240 km/h (149.1 mph). If necessary, the Audi e-tron GT concept can be charged in a 
short space of time. The high-voltage system is designed for a voltage of 800 volts and allows 
the battery to be charged to 80 percent in about 20 minutes at a DC terminal with an output of 
350 kW. In accordance with the WLTP standard, the Audi e-tron GT concept achieves a range of 
more than 400 kilometers (248.5 mi) on one battery charge.
The battery, which has an energy content of more than 90 kWh, is located in the underbody, 
between the axles. The battery package is designed with recesses in the rear footwell. This 
provides a high level of seating comfort for all occupants. This special layout allows the drive 
battery to be integrated in the vehicle floor despite the low body position that is typical for 
sports cars, thereby creating a very low vehicle center of gravity. At the same time, this creates 
comfortable seating ergonomics.
Its lightweight design body and the roof made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) are 
built according to the principle of multi-material construction. At 4.96 meters (16.3 ft) long, 
1.96 meters (6.4 ft) wide and 1.38 meters (4.5 ft) tall, the near-production-level Audi e-tron 
GT concept has the proportions of a typical Gran Turismo. 
In combination with the low center of gravity, the quattro drive, which is equipped with an 
electric motor at the front and rear axles, offers ideal conditions for a sports car. 
The drive management distributes the torques of the electric motors between the axles as 
needed and also regulates the wheels separately. The technology layout allows for numerous 
suspension and performance features, for example all-wheel steering or a sport differential, 
providing excellent traction and a high level of vehicle dynamics. 
Electric motors with different outputs and battery modules with different capacities will be
used in series production.
