 Ageing based on use use are called cycle ageing and ageing based on time is called calendar agein. 

## Calender Ageing

Most cars are parked more than they are driven. Calender aging is degradation that happens while time passes.

The factors that affects calender aging is State of Charge and environmental temprature.

## Cycle ageing

Cycle ageing is the reduction of energy capcaity or power caused bey charging/discharging.

- Don't park car with High SOC over long time
- Don't park car in extreme heat
- Dont
