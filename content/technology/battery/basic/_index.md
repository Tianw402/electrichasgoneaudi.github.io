description: The bacis principle of a li-ion battery is that electrical energy is created by an electrochemical reaction between two metals of different affinities.

A battery is made up of an anode, cathode, separator, electrolyte, and two current collectors (positive and negative).

The anode and cathode store the lithium. The electrolyte carries positively charged lithium ions from the anode to the cathode and vice versa through the separator.

The movement of the lithium ions (lithium atoms with more protons than electrons) creates free electrons in the anode which creates a charge at the positive current collector.  
  
The electrical current then flows from the current collector through the electric motor in the EV to the negative current collector.
 
The separator blocks the flow of electrons inside the battery.
